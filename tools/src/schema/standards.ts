/**
 * Validate the schemas with a toolchain this repository did not write.
 *
 * `check:schema` is Musher policy — closed objects, canonical `$id`s, local
 * refs, naming. It is deliberately opinionated and deliberately ours. What it
 * cannot do is confirm that the documents are valid JSON Schema 2020-12 by
 * anyone else's reading, because it asks Ajv, and Ajv is also what
 * `check:examples` and `check:conformance` ask.
 *
 * The Sourcemeta CLI is a separate implementation, in a different language,
 * with its own reading of the dialect. `metaschema` is the part that must pass:
 * it is an independent second opinion on whether a published bundle is a valid
 * 2020-12 document at all.
 *
 * `lint` is advisory here rather than blocking, and the exclusions below are
 * reviewed rather than assumed — see EXCLUDED_RULES.
 *
 * The CLI is AGPL-3.0. It is used as a development and CI tool only; nothing it
 * produces is distributed, and no schema in this repository derives from it.
 *
 * NON-NORMATIVE, like everything under tools/.
