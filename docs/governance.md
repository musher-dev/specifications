# Governance

## Scope of this repository

This repository contains **implementation-independent, public-facing Musher
contracts** and nothing else.

**In scope**

- Normative specification prose
- JSON Schema 2020-12 documents for user-authored documents
- Language-neutral conformance fixtures
- Migration rules between specification versions
- Architecture decision records covering the above

**Out of scope**

- Internal persistence or desired-state schemas → `musher-dev/platform`
- API request/response and OpenAPI documents → `musher-dev/platform`
- Generated language bindings (Go structs, TypeScript types, Rust traits) →
  the respective SDK and implementation repositories
- Executable binaries, reference validators, and WebAssembly modules — see
  [Binary policy](#binary-policy)

## Roles

**Maintainers** review and merge changes, cut releases, and arbitrate
specification disputes. Current maintainers are listed in
[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../.github/CODEOWNERS).

**Contributors** are anyone opening an issue or pull request. No agreement
beyond the [DCO](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work) is required.

## Decision process

Ordinary changes — a new optional field, a corrected description, an additional
conformance fixture — need green CI. Green CI is the whole of the mechanical
gate: review is required only on the paths listed in
[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../.github/CODEOWNERS), which are the review gate's own two
configuration files and nothing else.

Maintainer approval is still expected on a change of consequence, and this
document still requires it where it says so below. What changed is that it is
requested rather than enforced. A blanket approval requirement was tried and
measured: with one maintainer it blocked every pull request that maintainer opened,
and was merged past with an administrator bypass every time, which enforced nothing and
taught the bypass. [ADR 0015](adr/0015-selective-code-owner-review.md)
records the reasoning and what it costs.

Structural changes need an accepted ADR first. That covers:

- Adding or removing a specification family
- Changing the release, versioning, or publication model
- Any change requiring a new major version
- Changing the conformance fixture contract
- Changing core — admitting a rule to the
  [core specification](../specifications/core/v1/spec.md), moving one out of it, or
  changing what a family takes from it

ADRs live in [`docs/adr/`](adr/README.md), are numbered sequentially, and are
immutable once accepted — supersede, never rewrite. The one edit an accepted ADR
admits is retargeting a relative link whose target moved, as
[ADR 0021 §4](adr/0021-repository-organized-around-the-family-version.md)
sets out. `task check:adr` compares each accepted ADR with only its relative
link targets blanked, and absolute URLs compared verbatim, so it fails any other
edit. It cannot tell whether a retargeted link's target really moved; confirming
that is a review obligation.

## Compatibility review

Any change that rejects a previously valid document or changes its defined meaning
under the same pinned external context is a
**breaking change**. It requires:

1. Explicit approval from a maintainer listed in CODEOWNERS
2. A new `v<N>` major directory — the previous major keeps working unchanged
3. A migration note in the new major's `spec.md`

Requirement 1 is an obligation on the maintainer, not a gate the repository
enforces: `specifications/`, which holds every family's prose, schemas and
conformance corpus, is deliberately unowned, so a breaking change is not blocked
awaiting a review. What *is* enforced on every pull request is the machinery
that detects the breakage — `check:compat`, `check:published`, and the
conformance suite, all required. See
[ADR 0015 §4](adr/0015-selective-code-owner-review.md).

Adding a required field, narrowing an enum, tightening a pattern, and removing
a field are all breaking. Adding an optional field is compatible only when omission preserves existing meaning.

**Valid means valid against the released specification**, of which `spec.md` is
the definitive part, not merely accepted by the reference tooling or left
unpinned by the corpus. So giving a code and a case to a condition the released
prose already rejects is a defect fix and a minor release, not a narrowing, and
a release that deliberately *stops* rejecting a document declares that case so
`check:compat` can tell the relaxation from a regression.
[ADR 0032](adr/0032-correcting-a-released-family-within-its-major.md) states
both, and the bound on the first: the rule must be one a reader can be shown in
the released prose. A rule that has to be reconstructed is a new rule, and a new
rule that narrows validation is a new major.

One narrow exception applies before a family's first release.
[ADR 0005](adr/0005-platform-divergence-reconciliation.md) §1 sets it out:
while a family has no published version, requirements 2 and 3 do not apply,
because the compatibility guarantee is stated against a released version and
there is none to run from. Requirement 1 still applies, as does declaring the
change as breaking. The exception closes for a family the moment its first tag
is created.

## Changing a controlled vocabulary

A field whose value comes from a closed `enum` is a controlled vocabulary this
repository decides — [ADR 0003](adr/0003-controlled-vocabulary-placement.md)
§1 calls it placement one. Adding a term is a minor release; removing one is
breaking, and therefore a new major.

That asymmetry is the whole problem. Growth is cheap in every individual case
and irreversible in aggregate, so the rule below is editorial rather than
technical: nothing in CI can fail a term that is merely a bad idea.

### An open taxonomy: listing `category`

A candidate term must justify itself **against the terms that already exist**,
and the proposing pull request must say so in three parts:

1. **Which existing terms it was tested against**, and why each is wrong for the
   listings it is meant to hold. A term proposed without this reads as an
   addition; with it, it reads as a gap.
2. **That it is how a buyer browses, not what the software is built with.** A
   category answers "what am I looking for". The technology an item is made of
   is what `tags` carries, and a term that would have been a good tag is not a
   category.
3. **That it is not a subset of an existing term.** A term that splits an
   existing one in two makes both less useful, because a listing that could sit
   in either now sits in whichever its author picked.

Approval is one maintainer. `specifications/` is unowned, so nothing blocks the
merge awaiting it — a category addition is one of the changes where the
obligation in Decision process is real and the gate is not. What is not ordinary
is that a reviewer is expected to reject a well-formed term on editorial grounds —
a taxonomy is judged by what it excludes, and twenty categories is a taxonomy
while sixty is a list with none.

**There is no numeric ceiling, and the reason is worth stating.** A cap would be
honoured only by refusing every candidate once it was reached, because the
alternative — merging two terms to make room — is a removal and therefore a new
major. A limit that cannot be enforced within the major it applies to is a limit
in name, and it would displace the judgement that actually does the work.

### A closed progression: listing `lifecycleStage`

`lifecycleStage` is not a taxonomy and does not share the rule above. It is a
short ordered progression describing maturity, and its terms are not
alternatives an author chooses between on taste — each one makes a claim about
the item that the storefront acts on.

Adding a stage therefore changes what the storefront *means*, not how it sorts,
and needs an **accepted ADR** rather than the admission test. The same is true
of any other vocabulary of this shape.

## Release process

Releases are automated, one release line per family version, core included.
Merging a Conventional Commit to `main` makes release-please, running as the
release GitHub App, open a release PR. The App's permissions and credentials are
listed in
[Publication → Prerequisites](publication.md#prerequisites-before-the-first-tag).
That PR records the pending version in the
[ledger](publication.md#the-ledger), [`published.json`](../published.json),
and merging it tags `<family>/v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`. The schema and a release archive
are then attached, with SLSA provenance, to a GitHub Release published as
immutable, and `https://specifications.musher.dev/` is deployed from the
verified assets. [docs/publication.md](publication.md) describes every step,
the ledger, the core gate, and recovery from a failed release.

Released versions are **immutable**. Tag deletion and update are blocked by
repository ruleset, a published release's assets cannot change, and
`published.json` is append-only — a rewritten tag, a changed asset, or an
edited entry fails verification and stops the deploy rather than silently
altering a URL documented as permanent. A flawed release is corrected by publishing a
superseding patch, and the flawed version is marked with `deprecated: true`.
HTTP `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers pointing at the migration guide are
planned, not generated yet
([ADR 0012](adr/0012-cloudflare-pages-publication.md), follow-up 1).

[ADR 0006](adr/0006-publication-from-tags.md) sets out why the ledger
exists, and [ADR 0023](adr/0023-published-bytes-are-immutable-release-assets.md)
makes released bytes immutable release assets.

## Deprecation and retirement

1. **Deprecate** — the field or version is annotated `deprecated: true`. Editors
   and the CLI surface a warning. It keeps working.
2. **Sunset** — a removal date is published, planned to be carried by a
   `Sunset` header that is not generated yet (ADR 0012 follow-up 1). Minimum six
   months from deprecation.
3. **Retire** — removal happens only in a new major version. Migration rules
   ship alongside it.

## Binary policy

This repository publishes **data artifacts only**: JSON Schema documents,
Markdown prose, and conformance fixture archives.

The generated pages at `https://specifications.musher.dev/` — the index pages and the
`/reference/` tree — are a rendering of those artifacts rather than a fourth
kind. They are informative, they are regenerated on every deploy, and no release
archive carries them: a tagged release ships the Markdown, never the HTML. See
[ADR 0017](adr/0017-generated-field-reference.md).

It deliberately does not publish a reference validator binary, a shared
validation library, WebAssembly modules, or generated language packages. A
reference implementation becomes the de facto standard, hides normative
behaviour inside compiled code, biases the specification toward one language's
standard library, and saddles this repository with production security
patching. Implementations conform to the prose and the fixtures — not to the
behaviour of a blessed executable.

## Tooling dependencies

Everything under `tools/` is non-normative and is never published. A dependency
there is a development and CI tool, not part of the contract, and nothing it
produces is distributed.

One is worth naming explicitly. [`@sourcemeta/jsonschema`](https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsonschema)
is **AGPL-3.0**, and it is used to meta-validate the schemas and to cross-check
every structural verdict against Blaze — a second, independent implementation of
JSON Schema 2020-12. Two validators agreeing is the point: everything else here
asks Ajv, so a schema Ajv reads differently from everyone else would pass every
gate and fail in the SDKs.

Using it as a CI tool does not place this repository's schemas or prose under
the AGPL, and no artifact this repository publishes derives from it. A
contributor without it sees the checks report themselves as skipped rather than
passed. In CI, where `CI=true`, a missing CLI fails them instead.

One more is worth naming, for a different reason.
[`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) uploads the publication
tree to Cloudflare Pages, and is handed the Cloudflare deploy token, which can
replace everything the site serves. It is not the only code that runs with a
credential. Every CI job runs the locked dependencies with a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and
the release artifacts job runs `bun install` and the tag's own tooling while
holding `contents: write` and `id-token: write`. That is why the whole of
`tools/` is installed from the lockfile, never resolved at run time. wrangler is
named because its token reaches outside GitHub. It is pinned to an exact version
in `tools/package.json` and the lockfile rather than fetched at deploy time, so
the code that receives the token changes only through a diff someone opened
deliberately — never through a resolution that moved on its own. `tools/` is not a CODEOWNERS path, so that
diff is not gated on a review; the exact pin plus the lockfile is what carries
the guarantee. For the same reason it is excluded from the grouped Dependabot
update in [`.github/dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml): folded into four
other packages' lockfile churn it would arrive as a diff nobody opened *for
it*, which is not the deliberate one this paragraph promises. It always comes
as its own pull request. See
[ADR 0016](adr/0016-dependency-update-policy.md). Nothing published derives
from wrangler.
