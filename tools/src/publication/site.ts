/**
 * Assemble the publication tree deployed to https://specifications.musher.dev.
 *
 * Two URL shapes per family:
 *
 *   /<family>/v1/<family>.schema.json        moving alias within the major
 *   /<family>/v1.2.0/<family>.schema.json    immutable, published once
 *
 * **Pinned paths are served from verified immutable release assets, never
 * from the working tree and never rebuilt.** Releases are enumerated from
 * `published.json`, and each pinned bundle is read only from what
 * `task site:fetch` verified against its GitHub release and the ledger's
 * `bundleSha256` (docs/adr/0023 §7). A pinned URL neither moves when `main`
 * moves nor disappears when a newer version ships. A released major's alias is
 * its newest pinned bundle with `$id` restamped; the working tree feeds the
 * alias only until the major has its first release.
 *
 * The origin is Cloudflare Pages, so the cache contract is stated here rather
 * than in an edge rule this repository cannot see. `_headers` is generated from
 * the same enumeration that writes the tree — there is no second list of paths
 * to keep in step — and its rules are deliberately non-overlapping, because
 * Pages merges every matching rule and comma-joins duplicate header names
 * rather than letting the more specific one win. `assertNoOverlap` holds that
 * property over the paths actually written, not over the paths someone
 * remembered. See docs/adr/0012.
 *
 * The guarantee that the bytes themselves never change is checked offline by
 * `task check:published` and online by `task site:fetch`.
