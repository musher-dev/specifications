# Component specification

A component document describes one reusable node of a blueprint's component
graph ([blueprint §4](../blueprint/v1/spec.md#components)): a workload Musher
runs, or an external service, plus the configuration contract it exposes. A component
is never deployed on its own; a [blueprint](../blueprint/README.md) composes it.

Component documents sit inside a
[catalog item](../core/v1/spec.md#item-directory) rather than naming one, commonly
as `components/<name>.yaml`, `component.yaml` or `component-<name>.yaml`, the
patterns [editors bind](../../docs/using-schemas.md#in-your-editor).

## Versions

| Major | Specification | Examples | Released? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v1` | [`v1/spec.md`](v1/spec.md) | [`v1/examples/`](v1/examples/) | Draft — no `component/v1.*` tag yet ([how to tell](../../docs/publication.md#draft-or-released)) |

## Start here

1. The [core specification](../core/README.md), which this one applies
2. [§2 Document envelope](v1/spec.md#envelope), for what this family binds
3. [§5 The component's shape](v1/spec.md#workload), including
   [§5.6 External components](v1/spec.md#external)
4. [§6 Configuration contract](v1/spec.md#contract), including
   [§6.3 Value schemas](v1/spec.md#value-schema)
5. [§8 Diagnostics](v1/spec.md#diagnostics)

An implementation implements every section of this specification and of each
specification it builds on, together with the external specifications they cite.
Logical values use the bounded JSON Schema profile in §6.3. The list above is
where to begin, not what to implement.

## Builds on

Core v1. [Blueprint](../blueprint/README.md) in turn applies this family. The
authoritative list is the "Normative dependencies" table in
[§2](v1/spec.md#envelope).

## Requirement IDs

| Prefix | Covers | Section |
|---|---|---|
| `COMP-EXT` | Workload or external node | [§5](v1/spec.md#workload), [§5.6](v1/spec.md#external) |
| `COMP-SRC` | Image source | [§5.1](v1/spec.md#source) |
| `COMP-EP` | Endpoints, and what refers to them | [§5.2](v1/spec.md#endpoints) |
| `COMP-ENVVAR` | Environment variables | [§5.3](v1/spec.md#env-vars) |
| `COMP-DESC` | Input and output descriptions | [§6](v1/spec.md#contract) |
| `COMP-OUT` | Outputs | [§6.2](v1/spec.md#outputs) |
| `COMP-VAL` | Value schemas | [§6.3](v1/spec.md#value-schema) |

Every ID, the clause stating it, and the cases pinning it:
[component/v1 in docs/traceability.md](../../docs/traceability.md#componentv1).

| Major-version alias | `https://specifications.musher.dev/component/v1/component.schema.json` |
| Exact release (after first release) | `https://specifications.musher.dev/component/v1.<MINOR>.<PATCH>/component.schema.json` |

Which one to use, and how to bind it, is in
[Using the schemas](../../docs/using-schemas.md). The schema is authored in
[`v1/schemas/src/`](v1/schemas/src/) and built with `task bundle`.
