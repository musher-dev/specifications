/**
 * The release pipeline, run locally against a `FixtureRepo`.
 *
 * Each step is the one CI runs: sources committed, `record` on the release
 * branch, the ledger committed, a tag at that commit, `stageRelease` at the
 * tag, the staged files published as an immutable release, and `fetchReleases`
 * verifying them into the cache the site reads. A test that needs a released
 * version goes through all of it, so no test can pass against a shortcut the
 * pipeline does not take.
