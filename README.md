# Musher Document Specifications

This repository defines the formats of the documents people write for
[Musher](https://musher.dev), and the rules for interpreting them: normative
prose, the JSON Schemas built from it, example documents, and language-neutral
conformance corpora. The platform API and Musher's internal data models are
specified elsewhere. An implementation that disagrees with what is published
here is defective.

**Status:** stable. Every family has released `1.0.0`, and
[`published.json`](published.json) lists every release. What makes a version
released: [Draft or released](docs/publication.md#draft-or-released).

## Specifications

| Family | Specification | Front page | Rendered prose |
|---|---|---|---|
| core | [`core/v1/spec.md`](specifications/core/v1/spec.md) | [README](specifications/core/README.md) | [core v1](https://specifications.musher.dev/reference/core/v1/spec/) |
| component | [`component/v1/spec.md`](specifications/component/v1/spec.md) | [README](specifications/component/README.md) | [component v1](https://specifications.musher.dev/reference/component/v1/spec/) |
| blueprint | [`blueprint/v1/spec.md`](specifications/blueprint/v1/spec.md) | [README](specifications/blueprint/README.md) | [blueprint v1](https://specifications.musher.dev/reference/blueprint/v1/spec/) |
| listing | [`listing/v1/spec.md`](specifications/listing/v1/spec.md) | [README](specifications/listing/README.md) | [listing v1](https://specifications.musher.dev/reference/listing/v1/spec/) |

The rendered prose is generated and informative. What each family describes and how they depend on one
another is set out in [specifications/README.md](specifications/README.md), and
which of its parts are normative in
[What is normative](specifications/README.md#what-is-normative).
