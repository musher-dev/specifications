# Musher Component Document — Specification v1

**Status:** Draft (pre-stable)
**Family:** `component`
**Schema:** `https://specifications.musher.dev/component/v1/component.schema.json`

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and
[RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

> **What is normative.** This document, together with the
> [Musher Document Core Specification](../../core/v1/spec.md) it applies,
> defines the complete behaviour of the specification. The JSON Schema bundle is its executable form for structural
> validity, and the [conformance corpus](../../../docs/conformance.md) is its
> executable form for observable outcomes; both are normative, and neither is
> permitted to disagree with this document or with the other. Schema
> `description` fields, examples, generated documentation, and validator message
> text are informative.

## <a id="scope"></a>1. Scope

A **Component Document** defines one reusable, versioned graph node: either a
workload this platform runs — where its image comes from, how it runs, how its
health is determined — or one it does not, addressed elsewhere. Both kinds say
what configuration they consume and produce.

A Component Document does not describe a deployment. It is composed into a
[Blueprint Document](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md), which is what gets deployed.

**Out of scope for this document**

- Composition of multiple components → `blueprint` family
- Storefront presentation → `listing` family
- Runtime state, instances, and endpoints → the Musher API

## <a id="envelope"></a>2. Document envelope

```yaml
specVersion: v1
kind: COMPONENT
metadata: { … }
spec: { … }
```

A Component Document is a Musher document as the
[Musher Document Core Specification](../../core/v1/spec.md) defines one, and
every rule of core v1 applies to it. This family binds the parameters
[core v1 §1.1](../../core/v1/spec.md#bindings) leaves to a family:

| Core parameter | This family |
|---|---|
| `kind` ([`CORE-ENV-002`](../../core/v1/spec.md#CORE-ENV-002)) | `COMPONENT` |
| `metadata` ([`CORE-ENV-003`](../../core/v1/spec.md#CORE-ENV-003)) | [§4](#metadata) |
| Fields accepting `null` ([`CORE-ENV-007`](../../core/v1/spec.md#CORE-ENV-007)) | `schedule` — [§5](#workload) |
| Item document ([core v1 §4.1](../../core/v1/spec.md#item-directory)) | No — it sits inside an item |

This specification narrows core v1 where it says so and relaxes it nowhere. It
cites core by its line — "core v1 §N" — and the core edition a release was
built and tested against is recorded with that release
([core v1 §9](../../core/v1/spec.md#editions)).

**Normative dependencies**

| Specification | Line |
|---|---|
| [core](../../core/v1/spec.md) | v1 |

Under [`CORE-ENV-007`](../../core/v1/spec.md#CORE-ENV-007), one placement
survives in v1, and it is named rather than left to judgement:
[§5](#workload)'s `schedule: null`, where a *forbidden* field is written in its
own empty form and `null` is an author saying "deliberately none". A future
field where clearing an inherited value differs from not setting one would be
the second; this contract has no patch semantics, so there is none.

## <a id="compatibility"></a>3. Version compatibility

Stated once for every family in
[core v1 §3](../../core/v1/spec.md#compatibility), and applies without
narrowing.

## <a id="metadata"></a>4. Metadata

`metadata` carries `revision` and nothing else. A component document has no
`slug`. A [blueprint](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#identity) and its listing each
name the item they are two halves of; a component is not the item, and the name
it answers to is the stem of the file that holds it — which is what a repo-local
reference spells out in full
([blueprint §4.1](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#component-reference)). Any other
property is `ERR_UNKNOWN_FIELD`, as
[core v1 §2](../../core/v1/spec.md#envelope) requires at every level.

`revision` is an integer, 1 or greater. It is REQUIRED and never defaulted, so
what a node deploys is a function of this file alone.

**The revision names a position in one component's lineage.** It is not a SemVer
triple and carries no compatibility meaning: nothing is derivable from the
distance between 2 and 7, and nothing is promised about how one revision behaves
against another. It orders, and that is the whole of its job.

**Two reference forms pin it, and only one writes it down.**

| Reference form | What pins the revision |
|---|---|
| Repo-local | The referenced document's own `metadata.revision`. The node's `revision` MUST NOT be present. |
| Published | `revision` on the node. |

**A revision is used once.** Each publication of a component MUST carry a revision
strictly greater than the highest already published for that component. Gaps are
permitted — 1 to 7 is a release and not an error — but a revision that does not
increase is rejected in the `capability` phase with `ERR_VERSION_NOT_MONOTONIC`.

Reuse is the case the rule exists for. `revision: 3` on a published node
is the whole of what that node deploys, and a registry that let 3 mean two
different documents would make the pin name nothing. The repo-local form has the
same problem one step removed: a blueprint that deployed revision 3 last month
and revision 3 today, with different bytes behind it, has no way to say so.

**Why the phase is `capability`.** Deciding the rule needs to know what was
published before, which needs the catalog, which needs the network — and
[core v1 §6](../../core/v1/spec.md#validation-layers) forbids the `parser`,
`structural` and `semantic` phases from requiring it. A client validating a
file it has just written cannot see the lineage and MUST NOT report this rule.
Offline validation is therefore
exactly as strict as it was.

Whether a registry treats an identical re-submission as a no-op rather than as a
publication is outside this contract. This document orders publications; it does
not define when two YAML files are the same document.

**The revision is not the item's revision.** The item's is the blueprint's
([blueprint §3](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#identity)), and it is pinned to no
component beneath it. The two numbers count different things: an item's revision
counts releases of the item, a component's counts releases of the component, and
in the published form one component is deployed by many items at once.

A release of a component an item deploys SHOULD be accompanied by a release of
the item, because the item's listing describes what would be installed and a
component that has moved makes that description stale. It is a SHOULD and
carries no diagnostic: the disagreement is visible only across two revisions,
and a validator is handed one.

**What v1 does not constrain.** Nothing orders one component's revisions against
another's — two components in the same item sitting at 4 and 11 mean nothing
worth reading into. Nothing checks a revision offline at all: `minimum: 1` is the
whole of the `structural` rule, and every other statement in this section is
either `capability` or a SHOULD.

## <a id="workload"></a>5. The component's shape

A component declares exactly one of `spec.workload` and `spec.external`, and
which key is present is what says whether this platform runs it.
[§5.1](#source) through [§5.5](#volumes) describe the first; [§5.6](#external)
describes the second.

<a id="COMP-EXT-001"></a>**`COMP-EXT-001`** — `spec` MUST declare exactly one of
`workload` and `external`. `structural`. A document declaring neither is
`ERR_MISSING_FIELD` at `/spec`, the field an author has to add; one declaring
both is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE` at `/spec/workload`, the field that should not have
been there.

`spec.workload` says how the component runs. Its `type` is the runtime shape,
and the shape decides which of the remaining fields carry meaning.

| Field | `SERVICE` | `WORKER` | `JOB` | `CRON` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `endpoints` | REQUIRED, ≥ 1 | forbidden | forbidden | forbidden |
| `command` | permitted | permitted | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `schedule` | forbidden | forbidden | forbidden | REQUIRED |
| `health.readiness` | see [§5.4](#health) | permitted | permitted | permitted |

`source`, `envVars`, and `volumes` are permitted on every kind. Every rule in
the table is decided in the `structural` phase.

**Forbidden means rejected, not ignored.** A forbidden field MAY be omitted, or
written in its own empty form — `endpoints: {}` for a mapping, `schedule: null`
for a nullable block. Anything else is an error, and the two empty forms are
not interchangeable: `endpoints` is a mapping and takes no null,
`schedule` is a nullable block and takes no empty mapping.
[Core v1 §2](../../core/v1/spec.md#envelope) has already settled why — a
misspelled field is an error rather
than a silently ignored one, "including when the misspelled field is optional,
where ignoring it would silently substitute the default". A `schedule` on a
`SERVICE` fails for the same reason: an author who writes one believes their
service is scheduled, and accepting it silently is how that belief survives to
production.

**`command` is a different case from `schedule`.** A `JOB` and a `CRON` have
nothing to run without it, so it is REQUIRED on both. On a `SERVICE` or a
`WORKER` it overrides the image's default command, which is meaningful rather
than meaningless, so it stays permitted.

**A `SERVICE` MUST declare at least one endpoint.** A service is the kind that
serves, and one exposing nothing is a `WORKER` under another name. Permitting
it would leave `type` describing nothing: two documents would differ in the
word they use for a workload that runs identically, and a reader could not tell
from the `type` whether anything could reach it.

Both spellings of "none" are rejected, and they carry different codes because
they read differently to an author. An absent `endpoints` block is
`ERR_MISSING_FIELD` — the author has not said how the service is reached. A
block written and left empty is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE` — the author has said, and
said nothing. Both are `structural`.

This is the one rule in this section where a workload that runs perfectly well
is refused. A container that listens on no port and is meant to stay up is a
real thing to want; it is a `WORKER`, and writing it as one costs an author a
single word.

Input and output keys are unique within a component because `contract.inputs`
and `contract.outputs` are mappings. A repeated key is `ERR_DUPLICATE_KEY` in
the `parser` phase, before any rule in this section is considered.

### <a id="source"></a>5.1 Source

`source` is discriminated on `type`.

**`IMAGE`.** `ref` is REQUIRED and names a prebuilt OCI image. There is no
`build` on this branch — a prebuilt image is not built again, and the field is
absent rather than ignored so it cannot be misread as an override.

**`GIT`.** `repositoryURL` and `build` are both REQUIRED. `ref` is OPTIONAL and
pins a branch or a commit; omitting it takes the repository's default branch. A
`BRANCH` ref resolves at build time, so two builds of one unchanged document
can produce different images. A `COMMIT` ref is reproducible. Neither is
rejected, but a component that must build reproducibly SHOULD pin a commit.

**A build-argument name takes the environment-variable grammar.** A key of
`build.arguments` MUST match `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$` and be 1 to 128 characters,
and one that does not is rejected in the `structural` phase with
`ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. It becomes an environment variable in the build context,
so it is bound by the same POSIX shape [§5.3](#env-vars) requires of a runtime
key, for the same reason: a name outside it is not portably settable.

**Image references MUST be pinned.** An unpinned reference mutates under
whoever curates the registry, shifting a deployment with no change to any
document in the item. Two layers enforce it, and the split between them is
deliberate.

A reference MUST carry a tag or a digest. A bare name — an implicit `:latest` —
is rejected in the `structural` phase with `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. That is a
grammar, so the schema carries it.

<a id="COMP-SRC-001"></a>A reference MUST NOT carry a floating tag. The floating set is `latest`,
`main`, `main-stable`, `master`, `stable`, `edge`, `nightly`, `dev`, and
`rolling`, compared case-insensitively; a reference whose tag is one of them is
rejected in the `semantic` phase with `ERR_UNPINNED_IMAGE`.

**Why the floating set is not a `pattern`.** It is a curated list and it will
grow. Growing a `pattern` makes a previously valid document invalid, which is a
major version. Held as a `semantic` rule instead, the list can be extended in a
minor release — the grammar above is fixed and belongs in the schema, the
blocklist is not and does not.

A digest pin — `@sha256:` followed by 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits —
satisfies both rules whatever tag accompanies it, because the digest is what
resolves. The floating-tag rule applies only to a reference carrying no digest.

### <a id="endpoints"></a>5.2 Endpoints

`endpoints` is a mapping from endpoint name to one port the workload listens
on. `containerPort`, `protocol` and `visibility` are all REQUIRED — an endpoint
missing any of them describes a port nothing can route to. Only a `SERVICE` may
declare one; [§5](#workload) carries the rest of that rule.

**An endpoint name is a reference.** A name MUST match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,19}$` — lowercase alphanumeric, one to twenty characters —
and one that does not is rejected in the `structural` phase with
`ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. The name is not decoration: [§5.4](#health) points a probe
at one and a blueprint's
[platform default](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources) derives an address
from one, so a dot or a space in a name is a hazard rather than a matter of
taste.

**The grammar is narrower than a slug, and deliberately.** A name does not
become a DNS label; it is composed *into* one, beside the other names that
identify the deployment. Two properties follow from that, and neither holds for
the label grammar [core v1 §5.1](../../core/v1/spec.md#label-grammar)
names:

1. **A separator has to survive.** Whatever character an implementation joins
   the parts with, a name drawn from the same alphabet as the parts it joins to
   cannot be delimited — with `-`, endpoint `api` on a component named `web` and
   a component named `api-web` compose to the same label. Doubling the separator
   only helps if neither side may contain the doubled form, which a
   hyphen-bearing grammar permits. Alphanumeric makes any hyphen separator
   unambiguous by construction.
2. **The label budget is shared.** A DNS label holds 63 characters, and the
   endpoint name is one of several things inside it. A name permitted to reach
   62 leaves nothing for the rest, which forces every implementation into a
   truncation rule of its own — and truncation reintroduces exactly the
   collisions the grammar was meant to prevent. Twenty characters leave at least
   forty for everything else.

Twenty characters also fit every name worth having — `web`, `api`, `grpc`,
`metrics`, `console`, `admin`. A name that does not fit is describing something
an endpoint name should not be describing.

**`containerPort` is an integer from 1 to 65535.** Outside that range there is
no port to bind. The bound is `structural` and carries `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

A port below 1024 SHOULD NOT be used. Binding one needs a capability the runtime
grants to the container, and a workload that does not hold it fails at deploy
time with nothing in the document to blame. It stays advice rather than a
rejection because whether that grant exists is a fact about the runtime this
document cannot see, and a rule that rejects on a fact it cannot check is
guessing. Making it a MUST later rejects documents v1 accepts, and is therefore
breaking.

**Every protocol may be `PUBLIC`, and the address form is what differs.**
`visibility: PUBLIC` publishes the endpoint at an externally reachable address.
Which kind of address depends on the protocol, and the distinction is what the
two rules below turn on:

| `protocol` | What a `PUBLIC` endpoint publishes |
|---|---|
| `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `WS`, `GRPC` | A **URL**, on a hostname derived from the endpoint name. |
| `TCP`, `UDP` | A **`host:port` address**, on a port allocated from the edge. |

Nothing here is `structural`: a `PUBLIC` `TCP` endpoint is a database, a game
server, an MQTT broker or an SMTP relay exposed to the internet, and rejecting
it would make a working capability inexpressible. What the split does decide is
which references may name such an endpoint. [§5.4](#health)'s probe reads a URL
and may name only the first row.
[Blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources)'s platform default
reads either, and each of its four sources is tied to the row it takes its value
from.

**A component MAY declare more than one `PUBLIC` endpoint**, and each one
publishes its own address. A component fronting an API on one port and a console
on another is one component rather than two, and nothing about routing the
second is harder than routing the first.

The consequence is a rule and not a caveat: **anything naming a public address
MUST name the endpoint it means.** Where two exist there is no such thing as
"the component's URL".
[Blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources) is where that bites,
and where the selector lives.

**The primary endpoint.** A reference MAY omit the endpoint it targets. A
probe's `endpoint` and a blueprint platform default's are both OPTIONAL, and the
primary endpoint is what an omitted one selects. It is:

1. the workload's sole endpoint, where it declares exactly one; failing that
2. its sole `PUBLIC` endpoint, where it declares exactly one; failing that
3. nothing.

<a id="COMP-EP-001"></a>Where it is nothing, a reference that omits the endpoint is rejected in the
`semantic` phase with `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ENDPOINT`. The schema cannot express this
for the reason [§5.4](#health) gives: the endpoint names are mapping keys
elsewhere in the document.

"Nothing" is reached two ways and both are rejected, though they read
differently to an author. A workload declaring several candidates has too many
and must choose. A workload declaring no endpoint at all has none, and a probe
on it polls a port that does not exist. [§5](#workload) puts the second beyond
a `SERVICE`, which MUST declare at least one endpoint — but the other three
kinds declare none and may still carry a probe, so the case survives there.

**Why that is an error rather than a tiebreak.** Electing the first name in sort
order would give every document an answer, and would let a new endpoint called
`api` silently re-point a probe that has worked for a year. A rule that changes
what an unedited line means is the failure
[core v1 §2](../../core/v1/spec.md#envelope) rejects a misspelled
optional field to avoid.

**What v1 does not constrain.** Two endpoints MAY declare the same
`containerPort`, and nothing says which of them anything routing to that port
should believe. That silence is a gap rather than a considered permission, and
is recorded here so a reader can tell the two apart. Closing it rejects
documents that validate today.

The edge address of a `PUBLIC` `TCP` or `UDP` endpoint **is** readable from the
contract. [Blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources)'s
`PUBLIC_ADDRESS` derives the whole `host:port` and `PUBLIC_PORT` the allocated
port alone, so a blueprint whose node needs a broker's or a database's edge
address at install time can say so.

### <a id="env-vars"></a>5.3 Environment variables

`envVars` is a **sequence** of entries, each pairing a `key` with a `value`. It
is the one collection in this document that is not a mapping, and that shape
decides more than it looks like it should — [§5](#workload)'s argument that
"input and output keys are unique within a component because `contract.inputs`
and `contract.outputs` are mappings" does not reach here. A repeated env-var key
is not `ERR_DUPLICATE_KEY` in the `parser` phase, because at the YAML level
nothing is repeated: two entries of a sequence are two entries.

**A key MUST match `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`** and be 1 to 128 characters. That is
the POSIX shape, and it is REQUIRED rather than conventional: a name outside it
is not portably settable by the thing that has to set it. The rule is
`structural` and carries `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

`value` is discriminated on `type`.

| `type` | Carries | What the document holds |
|---|---|---|
| `LITERAL` | `value`, and OPTIONAL `sensitive` | The value itself. An empty string is permitted. |
| `CONFIG_REF` | `configKey` | A reference. The document never holds the value. |

<a id="COMP-ENVVAR-001"></a>**A key is declared once.** Two entries sharing a key are rejected in the
`semantic` phase with `ERR_DUPLICATE_ENV_KEY`, anchored at the **later** of the
two — the first declaration is the one that stands, so the second is the one an
author has to change. Without this rule the sequence shape would make a repeated
key mean whatever an implementation's last write happened to be.

<a id="COMP-ENVVAR-002"></a>**A key is claimed by one declaration.** An input's
[`target.envVarKey`](#inputs) binds a resolved value into the environment, so it
competes for the same namespace these entries do. Two declarations of one key
are rejected in the `semantic` phase with `ERR_CONFLICTING_ENV_KEY`, in both
shapes it can take:

- an `envVars` entry whose `key` equals some input's `target.envVarKey`, and
- two inputs declaring the same `target.envVarKey`.

The diagnostic anchors at an input's `target/envVarKey` in both cases, and where
two inputs collide it anchors at the later of the two in **lexicographic
input-name order**. Anchors are normative
([core v1 §7](../../core/v1/spec.md#diagnostics)), so the tiebreak
is written down rather than left to whichever order an implementation iterates
a mapping in.

**There is no precedence order**, and there is nothing for one to resolve: a
collision is an error, so no key is ever claimed twice. Ranking the two instead
— letting a contract-supplied value quietly outrank a literal, or the reverse —
would settle the ambiguity without telling anyone there was one, and the
consequence would surface as a wrong value inside a running workload rather than
as a diagnostic. [Blueprint §5.1](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#coverage) refuses
the same trade for two inputs one parameter covers, on the same ground.

**Sensitivity.** `sensitive` on a `LITERAL` marks the value as secret
material. An implementation MUST treat a marked value as it treats a value
whose [`schema.sensitive`](#value-schema) is `true`: masked in read surfaces, and
never echoed back into logs, diagnostics, or interfaces. It defaults to `false`,
so an unmarked literal is handled as ordinary configuration.

A `CONFIG_REF` carries no marking and needs none. It names a value resolved
elsewhere and the document holds only the name, so there is nothing in this file
to mask.

A component SHOULD carry secret material as a `CONFIG_REF`, or as an input
whose `schema.sensitive` is `true` ([§6.1](#inputs)), rather than as a marked
literal. `sensitive`
governs how a value is *handled*; it does not stop the value being bytes in a
file that is read, reviewed, and committed. It is a SHOULD because a marked
literal is still better than an unmarked one, and this document cannot see where
the file lives.

### <a id="health"></a>5.4 Health probes

Three staged probes. Each is OPTIONAL unless the rule below applies, and each
polls an HTTP path.

| Probe | Gate | Consequence of failure |
|---|---|---|
| `startup` | Initialisation | The workload counts as not yet started. |
| `readiness` | Traffic | The replica leaves routing; it is not restarted. |
| `liveness` | Aliveness | The container is restarted. |

`path` is the only REQUIRED property of a probe. The rest default:
`initialDelaySeconds: 10`, `periodSeconds: 10`, `timeoutSeconds: 5`,
`successThreshold: 1`, `failureThreshold: 3`.

<a id="COMP-EP-002"></a>`endpoint` names the endpoint whose port the probe targets; omitting it selects
the primary endpoint [§5.2](#endpoints) elects, and is rejected with
`ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ENDPOINT` where that section elects none. A probe naming an
endpoint the workload does not declare is rejected with `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENDPOINT`.
Both are `semantic`, and the schema can express neither — the endpoint names are
mapping keys elsewhere in the document, and JSON Schema cannot constrain a value
against a sibling's keys.

**A probe MUST name an endpoint in the HTTP family.** Every probe polls an HTTP
<a id="COMP-EP-003"></a>path, so an endpoint whose `protocol` is `TCP` or `UDP` has nothing for one to
poll. A probe resolving to such an endpoint — by naming it, or by having the
primary election select it — is rejected in the `semantic` phase with
`ERR_ENDPOINT_NOT_HTTP`. The rule is `semantic` for the same reason as the two
above it.

**`readiness` is REQUIRED for a `SERVICE` exposing at least one `PUBLIC`
endpoint whose `protocol` is `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `WS` or `GRPC`**, and OPTIONAL
everywhere else — including on a `SERVICE` whose endpoints are all `PRIVATE`,
and on one whose only `PUBLIC` endpoint is `TCP` or `UDP`. The rule is narrow on
purpose. Without a readiness gate a public URL routes to a replica that is
running but not yet serving, and the first request a user makes is the one that
fails. A private consumer inside the mesh retries; a browser does not.

The `TCP`/`UDP` exemption is that same argument, not a second one. What
[§5.2](#endpoints) publishes for those protocols is a `host:port` address, and
an L4 consumer connecting to one retries exactly as a private consumer does.
Compelling a probe there would also compel an HTTP path against a port that
speaks no HTTP — a rule the document has no way to satisfy.

### <a id="volumes"></a>5.5 Volumes

`volumes` is a mapping from volume name to a declaration. `sizeGiB` and
`mountPath` are REQUIRED. `accessMode` (default `READ_WRITE_ONCE`) and
`readOnly` (default `false`) are OPTIONAL.

**A volume name is a DNS label.** A name MUST match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9]$` — the label grammar
[core v1 §5.1](../../core/v1/spec.md#label-grammar) names, which a blueprint node
name also takes — and
one that does not is rejected in the `structural` phase with
`ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. A volume is materialised under its name, so the name has
to survive being one.

`mountPath` MUST be absolute. A relative path is rejected in the `structural`
phase with `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

`accessMode` decides how the materialised volume is shared across replicas.
`READ_WRITE_ONCE` is an attached block volume and mounts on a single replica;
`READ_WRITE_MANY` is a shared network volume and mounts on every replica.

**What v1 does not constrain.** Two volumes on one workload MAY declare
overlapping mount paths, and `sizeGiB` has no lower or upper bound. Neither
silence is a considered permission — both are gaps, in this specification and
in the implementations reading it, and they are recorded here rather than
described aspirationally so that a reader can tell which silences are
decisions. Closing either one rejects documents that validate today and is
therefore a breaking change.

### <a id="external"></a>5.6 External components

`spec.external` says that this platform does not run the component. Present
instead of [`workload`](#workload), it describes a node addressed elsewhere —
a service the deploying user already has, or one another provider operates.

```yaml
spec:
  external:
    resourceType: dev.musher.llm.chat-completions
  contract:
    inputs: { … }
    outputs: { … }
```

**The block carries one field, because there is one thing to say.** An external
node has no image, no compute, no endpoints, no health and no address of its
own. What it *is* is named by `resourceType`; what it *holds* arrives through
[`contract.inputs`](#inputs) like any other configuration, and what it offers
the rest of the graph leaves through [`contract.outputs`](#outputs).

<a id="COMP-EXT-002"></a>**`COMP-EXT-002`** — `external.resourceType` is
REQUIRED and takes the grammar [§6.3](#value-schema) fixes. `structural`; an
absent identifier is `ERR_MISSING_FIELD` and an ungrammatical one
`ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. It is REQUIRED rather than defaulted because an identifier
a document may leave out is one two implementations may read differently, and
introducing it later is introducing a required field later.

**It is the same grammar and the same registry as a value's, read of a
different thing.** A value's `resourceType` says what that value addresses,
which is what [blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) compares
across a wire. This one says what the *node* is, which is what a reader of the
graph needs in order to see one participant rather than three unrelated
strings. Three tagged outputs do not compose into a node's identity, and
electing one of them as the node's would be the designated-primary mistake
[listing §3](../../listing/v1/spec.md#identity) rejects for a `COMPONENT` item.

<a id="COMP-EXT-003"></a>**`COMP-EXT-003`** — An external component MUST
publish at least one output. `structural`; an absent `contract` is
`ERR_MISSING_FIELD` and a `contract` whose `outputs` mapping is empty is
`ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. The two spellings carry different codes for the reason
[§5](#workload) gives for a `SERVICE` declaring no endpoint — the author who
omits the block has not said what the node offers, and the author who writes it
empty has said, and said nothing.

A node exists in a composition so that something can consume it. One publishing
nothing is a node nothing can need, which is the same argument that makes a
`SERVICE` exposing no port a `WORKER` under another name.

<a id="COMP-EXT-004"></a>**`COMP-EXT-004`** — An external component's outputs
MUST NOT declare `valueFrom: DERIVED`. `structural`, `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.
[§6.2](#outputs) makes a `DERIVED` value come from the running workload, and
there is no running workload. `DECLARED` and `INPUT` both stay available, and
`INPUT` is the member this shape exists alongside: an external node's values are
what its blueprint supplies it.

**How those inputs are supplied is not this document's concern.** An external
component declares what it needs exactly as a workload does ([§6.1](#inputs)).
Whether a value is typed by the deploying user or arrives over a wire is decided
by the [blueprint](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#parameters) that deploys the node.
A platform default has no addressing to read on a node with no endpoints, and
[blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources) rejects one there with
the codes it already uses for an endpoint that does not exist.

**What v1 does not constrain.** Nothing here reaches the service the node
addresses. No phase resolves the address, tests that anything answers at it, or
compares what answers against `resourceType` — and [§11](#security) explains
why that is a rule rather than an omission.

## <a id="contract"></a>6. Configuration contract

`spec.contract` is what makes a component composable. `inputs` are values the
component needs; `outputs` are values it publishes for another component to
consume. A [Blueprint](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md) connection joins one node's
output to another node's input, and this section defines both ends of that
join.

**The contract states requirements, never method.** An input says what value
the component needs, what shape it takes, whether the component can run without
it, and where it lands in the workload. It does not say who supplies it, how it
is generated, or how a person is asked for it. Those depend on the composition,
which this document cannot see, so they belong to the
[blueprint](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#parameters) that can: a connection, or a
parameter on its install form.

`contract` is OPTIONAL. A component that neither consumes nor publishes
configuration omits it.

<a id="COMP-DESC-001"></a>**`COMP-DESC-001`** — Every input and every output
MUST declare a non-empty `description`. `structural`; an absent `description`
is `ERR_MISSING_FIELD` and an empty one `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

The description is the one place a value is explained. A blueprint parameter
carries none of its own and shows the description of the input it covers, so a
value is described once, by the document that needs it, and every blueprint
deploying the component shows the same words. Optional, it would be missing
exactly where a reader has nothing else to go on: an output wired from a
component they did not write.

**An input or output name is `lowerCamelCase`.** A name MUST match
`^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]{0,63}$`, and one that does not is rejected in the
`structural` phase with `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. The grammar is load-bearing
rather than cosmetic: the name is bound by key across three documents — the
input, the [connection](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) key that fills
it, and the [parameter](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#coverage) that
covers it — so two spellings of one name are two names. It is not the
environment-variable key either; that is what [`target`](#inputs) carries, on
the POSIX grammar [§5.3](#env-vars) fixes.

### <a id="inputs"></a>6.1 Inputs

An input carries four properties, and each states part of the requirement.

| Property | Presence | Says |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | REQUIRED | What the value is ([`COMP-DESC-001`](#COMP-DESC-001)). |
| `schema` | REQUIRED | The shape its string form takes ([§6.3](#value-schema)). |
| `required` | OPTIONAL, default `true` | Whether the component can be deployed without a value. |
| `target` | OPTIONAL | Where the resolved value is bound in the workload. |

Nothing else is admitted, and any other property is `ERR_UNKNOWN_FIELD` as
[core v1 §2](../../core/v1/spec.md#envelope) requires at every level.

**An input does not say where its value comes from.** A blueprint satisfies it
by wiring an upstream output to it
([blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections)) or by covering it with
a parameter the deploying user fills in, the platform generates, or the platform
derives from the node's own addressing
([blueprint §5](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#parameters)). One component can be
deployed each of those ways by different blueprints without changing, which is
what a reusable definition is for. A property here naming the source would be a
claim about every composition the component will ever join, made by the one
document that sees none of them.

**A required input is satisfied or the blueprint is rejected.** `required`
defaults to `true`, so an input that says nothing about it is required. A
required input whose `schema` declares a `default` already has a value, and needs
nothing supplied. Every other required input MUST be wired or covered, and
[blueprint §5.1](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#coverage) carries the rule and its
diagnostic, because the blueprint is the document that can tell.

**Secret material is declared, not arranged.** An input whose value is a secret
declares `schema.sensitive: true`. Whether that secret is typed by a person or
minted at deploy time is a question about the deployment, and a blueprint that
generates one is held to covering only inputs marked this way
([blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources)).

### <a id="outputs"></a>6.2 Outputs

`schema`, `description` ([`COMP-DESC-001`](#COMP-DESC-001)) and `valueFrom` are REQUIRED.

| `valueFrom` | Carries | Where the value comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `DECLARED` | `value`, REQUIRED and non-empty | This document. |
| `DERIVED` | neither | The platform, from the running workload. |
| `INPUT` | `input`, REQUIRED | One of this component's own inputs. |

**An output depends on its own node and nothing else.** A `DECLARED` output's
value is written in this document. A `DERIVED` output's value comes from the
producing workload's own addressing — its private address, its public URL. An
`INPUT` output's value is one this component's own contract already receives.

That constraint is what makes an output referenceable at all: a consumer can
read a producer's output without the producer having first been told anything.
It is also what lets two components consume each other.
[Blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) permits a cyclic
connection graph, and this rule is why it can: every output in a composition is
resolvable before any connection is bound, so a cycle among the connections
leaves nothing unresolved.

**The invariant is resolvability before any edge is bound.** A value typed into
the install form resolves when the form is submitted, which is *earlier* than a
`DERIVED` output resolves, since that one needs a running, addressed workload. A
generated value is minted at deploy time out of nothing, and a platform default
reads the node's own addressing. Only a wired input resolves after an edge is
bound, and it is the only input an `INPUT` output may not read.

<a id="COMP-OUT-001"></a>**`COMP-OUT-001`** — `input` is REQUIRED where
`valueFrom` is `INPUT`, and MUST NOT be present on any other member.
`structural`; a missing `input` is `ERR_MISSING_FIELD` and one written beside
`DECLARED` or `DERIVED` is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

<a id="COMP-OUT-002"></a>**`COMP-OUT-002`** — `input` MUST name an input this
component declares. `semantic`, `ERR_UNKNOWN_INPUT_REFERENCE`, anchored at the
output's `input`. The name is a mapping key elsewhere in the same document,
which is the class of reference
[core v1 §6](../../core/v1/spec.md#validation-layers) puts in the `semantic`
phase.

**Which inputs are wired is the blueprint's to know, so the blueprint enforces
the rest.** A component cannot tell whether an input it republishes will arrive
over a connection, because [§6.1](#inputs) leaves the source to the composition.
[Blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) therefore rejects a
connection that fills an input one of the component's `INPUT` outputs reads. The
rule is the same one, decided by the document that can see both ends of it: an
output reading a wired input would depend on an inbound edge, and blueprint
§4.2's legal cycles would stop being resolvable.

**Where an output must fit the input it feeds.** An output's `schema` and the
`schema` of the input it is wired to must agree on `type`, and on
`resourceType` wherever the consuming input names one.
[Blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) states the rule and
carries the two diagnostics, because the connection is what joins the two ends
and a component document sees only one of them.

### <a id="value-schema"></a>6.3 Value schemas

An input and an output carry the same `schema` block, and this section defines
it once. `type` is its only REQUIRED property.

**A value is carried as text.** Whatever an input receives or an output
publishes reaches the workload as an environment variable, so `type` does not
name a host language's type — it names the shape the value's **string form**
takes. That is why `default` is a string, why `enum` is a list of strings, why a
`DECLARED` output's `value` is a string, and why `pattern` is a regular
expression over the same form.

**A `STRING_LIST` is one value too.** Its string form is a JSON array of
strings, each of them a member of `enum` and each appearing once —
`["logs","traces"]`. The empty array is the unset value, so a `STRING_LIST`
that has to be able to mean "none of them" declares `default: '[]'` rather than
reaching for a member that means it. A `default` is still a string, holding
that array's text.

<a id="COMP-VAL-001"></a>**`COMP-VAL-001`** — `type` MUST be one of five
members. Anything else is rejected in the `structural` phase with
`ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

| `type` | The string form is | `format` | `pattern` | `enum` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STRING` | any text | permitted | permitted | permitted |
| `NUMBER` | a JSON number — `5432`, `-1`, `2.5` | forbidden | permitted | permitted |
| `BOOLEAN` | `true` or `false`, in lower case | forbidden | permitted | permitted |
| `JSON` | a JSON value of any kind — object, array, string, number, boolean or null | forbidden | forbidden | MUST be empty |
| `STRING_LIST` | a JSON array of strings — `["logs","traces"]` | forbidden | forbidden | MUST be present and non-empty |

**There is no integer member, and the omission is deliberate.** `NUMBER` is
JSON's own numeric kind and covers whole numbers and reals alike. An author who
needs whole numbers writes the constraint rather than reaching for a second
type: `type: NUMBER` with `pattern: '^-?[0-9]+$'`. A separate `INTEGER` would
have to answer whether `5432.0` is one, whether an integer output satisfies a
number input under [blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections)'s
no-widening rule, and what a bound would mean on each — three answers bought for
a distinction the transport does not preserve.

<a id="COMP-VAL-002"></a>**`COMP-VAL-002`** — Where `type` is `JSON`, `pattern`
MUST NOT be present and `enum` MUST be empty. Both are `structural`: a
`pattern` is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE` and a non-empty `enum` is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

One JSON value has many spellings. `{"a":1}` and `{ "a" : 1 }` are the same
value, and so are `{"a":1,"b":2}` and `{"b":2,"a":1}`. A regular expression and
a string enumeration each decide membership on the spelling, so a rule written
with either would accept one author's formatter and reject another's. Permitting
them and leaving "equal" undefined is the worse option: two implementations
would then disagree about a valid document for a reason neither could see.

<a id="COMP-VAL-003"></a>**`COMP-VAL-003`** — Where `type` is not `STRING`,
`format` MUST NOT be present. `structural`, `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

Every `format` member names a lexical convention for text. `format: EMAIL` on a
`BOOLEAN` describes nothing, and that it validates today is an accident of the
two fields never having been described together. This clause is about the Musher
field `format`, not the JSON Schema keyword;
[core v1 §6.2](../../core/v1/spec.md#format-policy) is that.

<a id="COMP-VAL-004"></a>**`COMP-VAL-004`** — `format` is OPTIONAL, and where it
is present MUST be one of six members. Anything else is rejected in the
`structural` phase with `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

| `format` | The text is | Where the convention is published |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL` | a mailbox address | [RFC 5321 §4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321#section-4.1.2) |
| `URI` | a URI | [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) |
| `ENDPOINT_URL` | a URL addressing a network service | " |
| `CONNECTION_STRING` | a backing service's own connection form | the service's |
| `HOSTNAME` | a host name, and no port | [RFC 1123 §2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123#page-13) |
| `TIMEZONE` | a time-zone identifier | the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) |

The membership is written here rather than left to the schema's `description`,
which is informative. That is the defect
[ADR 0013](../../../docs/adr/0013-value-shape-vocabulary.md) closed for `type`,
and `format` was one sentence away from it.

**`HOSTNAME` is the host alone.**
[Blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources) already separates the
two, since `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` derives the host part and `PUBLIC_ADDRESS` the whole
`host:port`, for the reason given there: a consumer that takes host and port as
separate settings should not have to split a string this contract had already
composed. An input receiving one of them can now say which it received.

**`TIMEZONE` names a vocabulary this contract does not decide.** The identifiers
are IANA's — an `Area/Location` name such as `Europe/London` — and IANA revises
them several times a year, when a jurisdiction changes its rules and not when
this repository releases.
[ADR 0003](../../../docs/adr/0003-controlled-vocabulary-placement.md) §2
therefore obliges this section to name where they are published and forbids it
from restating them, dated or otherwise. The `format` member is this contract's;
the membership behind it is not. A renderer needs no list shipped with it —
every mainstream runtime already carries the database.

**None of the six is checked.** The paragraph below records that no phase tests a
value against the shape its `schema` declares, and `format` is no exception. Nor
is `TIMEZONE` resolved in the `capability` phase, which
[ADR 0003](../../../docs/adr/0003-controlled-vocabulary-placement.md) §3 reserves
for a membership a server decides and which nothing here asks it to: an author is
saying what convention a value follows, not asking for it to be confirmed. That
is a deviation from ADR 0003 §3's usual routing and is recorded rather than left
to be noticed.

<a id="COMP-VAL-005"></a>**`COMP-VAL-005` — `resourceType` names the resource a
value addresses.** It is OPTIONAL, and where it is present MUST match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(\.[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*)+$` — a reverse-DNS namespace, then one or
more lowercase segments. A value outside the grammar is rejected in the
`structural` phase with `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

`type` is the primitive shape a value takes; `resourceType` is what it
addresses, and the two answer different questions. A Postgres connection string
and a MySQL one are both `STRING` and both plausibly `CONNECTION_STRING`-shaped,
and wiring one into a consumer expecting the other is the mistake this tag
exists to catch — [blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections)
carries the rule that does the catching.

**The grammar is this contract's and the membership is not.** Which identifiers
exist is decided by what the platform offers and by what a third party
publishes, neither of which this repository observes, so it fixes the shape and
names the surface: the identifiers on offer are served, unauthenticated, at
`https://api.musher.dev/v1/reference/resource-types`. This document does not
restate them, not even informatively and not even dated, for the reason
[ADR 0003](../../../docs/adr/0003-controlled-vocabulary-placement.md) §2 gives.

**A grammatical identifier the registry does not name is reserved, not
invalid.** Deciding membership needs the registry, which needs the network,
which [core v1 §6](../../core/v1/spec.md#validation-layers) forbids the earlier
phases from reaching — so it
is `capability`, it carries `ERR_UNKNOWN_RESOURCE_TYPE`, and an offline
implementation MUST NOT report it. A namespace is what lets a component address
something this specification never heard of, and an offline validator rejecting
`com.acme.billing.tenant-key` would defeat the whole point of having one.

**`resourceType` is not paired with `type`.** Nothing here restricts which types
may carry which identifier — a `JSON` value describing a Postgres cluster
addresses that cluster as legitimately as a connection string does. That the
pairing goes unchecked in either direction is a gap rather than a considered
permission; the registry records a primitive type per identifier, and nothing in
this contract reads it.

<a id="COMP-VAL-006"></a>**`COMP-VAL-006`** — Where `type` is `STRING_LIST`,
`enum` MUST be present and non-empty, and `pattern` MUST NOT be present. All
three are `structural`: an absent `enum` is `ERR_MISSING_FIELD`, an empty one
is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`, and a `pattern` is `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

**`enum` is required rather than optional.** A `STRING_LIST` with no members
named would be an unconstrained list of strings, which is what `JSON` already
is, and [blueprint §5.3](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#install-form)'s derivation
would have nothing to offer: a
chooser with no choices is a text box that has been made harder to type into.
The member is for the shape an install form can honestly ask for — several of a
named set — and a document that has not named the set has not reached it.

**`pattern` is forbidden for `COMP-VAL-002`'s reason, arriving by a second
door.** The string form is a JSON array, `["a","b"]` and `[ "a" , "b" ]` are one
value spelled two ways, and a regular expression decides membership on the
spelling. What an author wants constrained is each member, and `enum` — which
is required here — is the field that constrains each member.

**`format` needs no clause of its own.** [`COMP-VAL-003`](#value-schema)
above already forbids it wherever `type` is not `STRING`, and a `STRING_LIST`
is not a `STRING`. The
row in the table above records the outcome rather than a second rule, and
[`structural/074`](conformance/structural/074-string-list-with-a-format/)
is the fixture that holds it down.

**The multiplicity is in `type` rather than beside it.** An earlier draft of
this member, and the issue that asked for it, spelled it as a boolean
`multiple` sitting next to `type: STRING`. Every contract that decides this
question for data rather than for a control puts it in the type — JSON Schema's
`type: array` with `items`, Ansible's `type: list` with `elements`,
CloudFormation's `Type: CommaDelimitedList` with its per-member
`AllowedValues`, Terraform's `set(string)`, Protocol Buffers' `repeated`. Only
HTML spells it `multiple`, and there it is an attribute of `<select>`: a
statement about a control, which is the one thing
[blueprint §5.3](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#install-form) says this block never
makes. The practical half matters more than the provenance.
[Blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) compares `type` for
equality, and [blueprint §5.1](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#coverage) compares
whole `schema` blocks for the inputs one parameter covers, so a member is
compared at both doors the day it is added, while a
field beside `type` would have had to be remembered at each of them, and would
have been a silent gap at any one that was missed.

[ADR 0020](../../../docs/adr/0020-multi-value-value-shape.md) records the
decision and what it rejects.

**What v1 does not check.** No phase tests a **value** against the shape its
`schema` declares. A `DECLARED` output may write `type: NUMBER` beside
`value: 'banana'`; a `default` may ignore the `pattern` and the `enum` written
beside it; a `JSON` value's `default` is not parsed; a `STRING_LIST`'s
`default` is not parsed either, and nothing tests that a submitted array holds
members of `enum`, or that it repeats none of them. None of this is new with
`JSON` or with `STRING_LIST` — it has been true of every member since v1 — and
it is recorded here rather than described aspirationally, because the table
above is the first place a reader could reasonably expect the check to be.
Closing any of them rejects documents that validate today.

## <a id="validation-layers"></a>7. Validation layers

As defined in [core v1 §6](../../core/v1/spec.md#validation-layers), and
written in the <a id="yaml-profile"></a>YAML profile
[core v1 §6.1](../../core/v1/spec.md#yaml-profile) states. The JSON Schema
<a id="format-policy"></a>`format` keyword is governed by
[core v1 §6.2](../../core/v1/spec.md#format-policy).

## <a id="diagnostics"></a>8. Diagnostics

The codes in [core v1 §7](../../core/v1/spec.md#diagnostics) apply to every
document in this family. This family adds:

| Code | Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR_UNPINNED_IMAGE` | `semantic` | An image reference carries a floating tag. |
| `ERR_DUPLICATE_ENV_KEY` | `semantic` | Two `envVars` entries declare the same key. |
| `ERR_CONFLICTING_ENV_KEY` | `semantic` | An environment-variable key is claimed by more than one declaration. |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENDPOINT` | `semantic` | A reference names an endpoint the workload does not declare. |
| `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ENDPOINT` | `semantic` | A reference omits the endpoint, and the workload elects no primary. |
| `ERR_ENDPOINT_NOT_HTTP` | `semantic` | A reference reading a URL resolves to an endpoint whose protocol is not in the HTTP family. |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_INPUT_REFERENCE` | `semantic` | An `INPUT` output names no input this component declares. |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_RESOURCE_TYPE` | `capability` | A `resourceType` is grammatical but the registry names no such identifier. |
| `ERR_VERSION_NOT_MONOTONIC` | `capability` | A published component version is not greater than the lineage's current version. |

Every row above is this family's own, and three of them are reported by a
second family. `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENDPOINT`, `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ENDPOINT` and
`ERR_ENDPOINT_NOT_HTTP` are decided by [§5.2](#endpoints)'s endpoint names and
primary election, and a blueprint platform default resolves against those too
([blueprint §5.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#value-sources)), so that family
reports them against its own parameters. The rows are declared once here rather
than restated there, since blueprint names this specification among its
normative dependencies, which is the rule
[ADR 0003](../../../docs/adr/0003-controlled-vocabulary-placement.md) §2 applies
to a vocabulary and this table is no different.

## <a id="conformance"></a>9. Conformance

An implementation conforms to this specification when it produces the declared
outcome for every case in [this family's corpus](conformance/) and in the
[core corpus](../../core/v1/conformance/) at the core edition the release
records ([core v1 §8](../../core/v1/spec.md#conformance)). It MUST declare the
profile it claims, as [core v1 §8](../../core/v1/spec.md#conformance) requires. A
skipped case is never a passed one.

## <a id="known-debt"></a>10. Known debt

Each entry below is a gap this version leaves open, with the section that
records it.

**What an external component still cannot say.** [§5.6](#external) gives a node
this platform does not run an identity, a set of inputs and a set of outputs.
What it does not give is a *configured instance* two blueprints share: one saved
address and credential that three compositions point at. Every deployment
instantiates its own node and asks for its own values.

That is a gap with a reason rather than an oversight.
[Blueprint §4.2](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#connections) is explicit that a
connection cannot reach outside the graph it is written in, so sharing an
instance needs a reference form that does, plus a phase to resolve it — a new
contract surface rather than a field. What *is* reusable today is the
definition: many blueprints may reference one component document, and
[listing §3.1](../../listing/v1/spec.md#item-directory) already admits a catalog
item that is a single standalone building block, so a general-purpose external
component ships as its own item with nothing added to the listing family.

**An `input` reference has no grammar of its own.** [§6.2](#outputs)'s `input`
names a mapping key, and [§6](#contract) fixes the grammar those keys take, so
the reference is constrained by the same pattern the referent is. That is one
grammar rather than two, which is deliberate; it is recorded because a reader
looking for a rule about the reference will find it stated about the key.

What remains for this family is not a gap in the prose. `capability` rules —
`ERR_UNKNOWN_COMPONENT`, `ERR_VERSION_NOT_MONOTONIC`,
`ERR_COMPONENT_NOT_PUBLISHED`, `ERR_UNKNOWN_COMPUTE_PROFILE` — carry no
conformance fixture, because deciding any of them needs the catalog and no phase
a client runs may reach the network. Each is recorded with that reason in the
runner's `UNCOVERED` list rather than left to be assumed tested.

## <a id="security"></a>11. Security considerations

[Core v1 §11](../../core/v1/spec.md#security) applies in full: a component
document is untrusted input. This section adds what is specific to component.

**Image references.** [§5.1](#source) requires a tag or a digest and forbids a
floating tag, and both rules are about supply chain rather than tidiness. A
floating tag means the artifact that runs is not the artifact that was reviewed.
`ERR_UNPINNED_IMAGE` is `semantic` and therefore offline: an implementation MUST
NOT resolve a reference over the network to decide it, because doing so would let
a document under review make the validator issue a request to a host the document
chose.

**Build sources.** A `GIT` source names a repository and a revision that an
implementation will fetch and build. Fetching is a `capability` concern and out
of scope here, but an implementation MUST treat the build context as untrusted:
a checkout is attacker-controlled content, and a build path from it MUST NOT be
allowed to read outside the context it was given.

**Environment variables and secrets.** A component document is a public artifact
— it is committed, published in a catalog, and shipped inside a release tarball.
`envVars` carries configuration, and a literal value in one is visible to
everyone who can read the document. A secret MUST NOT be written as a `LITERAL`
value; that is what `CONFIG_REF` exists for. Nothing in the `structural` or
`semantic` phase can detect a secret pasted into a literal, so this is a rule
about authoring that an implementation SHOULD surface as a warning where it can.

**An external component's address MUST NOT become an egress vector.** The
address an [external node](#external) is configured with is supplied by an
author or by a deploying user, which makes it attacker-influenced in the sense
[core v1 §11](../../core/v1/spec.md#security) opens with. No phase of this
specification resolves it, connects to
it, or checks that anything answers there, and an implementation MUST NOT do so
on this contract's behalf: a reachability check against a user-supplied address
is a server-side request forgery primitive reachable from a catalog submission,
and it would reach cloud metadata endpoints and private-mesh services as
readily as the service the author meant. [§5.6](#external) records the same rule
as a validation silence; it is repeated here because the reason is a security
one and a reader of that section would otherwise read a gap where there is a
decision.

The consequence is that `resourceType` and `format: ENDPOINT_URL` on an external
node are claims, unverified, exactly as [§6.3](#value-schema) records of every
`format` member. What the node addresses is what its author says it addresses.
