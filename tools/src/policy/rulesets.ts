/**
 * Keep the two halves of the selective code-owner review gate in step.
 *
 * The gate is one mechanism split across two files. `.github/rulesets/
 * main-branch.json` pairs `required_approving_review_count: 0` with
 * `require_code_owner_review: true`, so review is demanded per changed file
 * rather than per pull request; `.github/CODEOWNERS` decides which files those
 * are. Break either half and the other becomes meaningless — but neither fails
 * loudly. A `*` catch-all restores the blanket gate. A count of `1` restores it
 * from the other side. Both changes look like tightening and read as harmless.
 *
 * The ruleset files are also `PUT` back to GitHub verbatim, which makes them
 * the rare config where a shape error is discovered in production: a leaked
 * server-side field makes the apply fail, and a mistyped required-check context
 * makes every pull request hang forever waiting for a check that will never
 * report. RUL-03 guards the first.
 *
 * The second was RUL-09, which checked that every required context is a job
 * some workflow publishes, in a workflow with no `paths:` filter. It retired
 * when the engineering conventions' GHA family, whose GHA-15 and path-filter
 * requirements check the same, became enforced (docs/adr/0037).
 *
 * See docs/adr/0015-selective-code-owner-review.md and
 * .github/rulesets/RULESETS.md.
 *
 * NON-NORMATIVE, like everything under tools/.
