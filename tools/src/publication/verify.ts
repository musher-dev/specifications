/**
 * Verify what this repository claims to have published, offline, against git —
 * `task check:published` (docs/adr/0023 §4).
 *
 *   entry + tag     `<tag>:<path>` must have the recorded tree id, and the tag's
 *                   own ledger must hold the same entry, and a kind family's core
 *                   tag must be an ancestor of it. Nothing is rebuilt and no
 *                   commit is reclassified: a released version is never
 *                   re-judged by newer tooling or configuration. Its bytes are
 *                   checked online, against the immutable release asset, by
 *                   `fetch.ts`.
 *   entry, no tag   a release pull request mid-flight. The manifest must name
 *                   the version, `tree` must equal `HEAD:<path>`, the pinned
 *                   bundle built from the working tree must hash to
 *                   `bundleSha256`, and the pending core gate must pass.
 *   tag, no entry   a tag created outside the release flow. Always a failure.
 *   manifest only   a manifest version other than 0.0.0 that is neither tagged
 *                   nor recorded: a release pull request whose ledger commit has
 *                   not landed. A failure, so the pull request cannot merge
 *                   until `release-ledger.yml` records it (docs/adr/0023 §4).
 *
 * NON-NORMATIVE, like everything under tools/.
