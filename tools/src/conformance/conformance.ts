/**

 * makes cross-language parity provable rather than asserted.
 *
 * Two kinds of check live here. Executing a case needs a phase this repository
 * implements; validating that a case is *well-formed* — that it cites a clause
 * that exists and declares codes the prose actually defines — does not. The
 * second kind runs for every case, including the ones the first kind skips,
 * because a `semantic` fixture would otherwise be checked by nothing at all.
 *
 * Two kinds of corpus live in the tree. A kind family's corpus runs through the
 * whole pipeline against that family's bundle. The core corpus runs through the
 * parser alone, with no bundle and no dispatch on `kind` (core v1 §8.1).
