# Musher Document Specifications

@../README.md

This repository is the normative source of truth for the documents Musher users
author: the prose, schemas, examples and conformance corpora that define them.
The CLI, the platform API and every SDK implement what is defined here.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Edit sources, never build output.** Schemas are authored in
   `specifications/<family>/v<N>/schemas/src/`. Bundles, `catalog.json` and
   `dist/` are build output, and `task check:generated` fails if any of them is
   tracked. `site/` is build output too, but only `.gitignore` keeps it out of
   git; no check covers it.
   `docs/traceability.md` and the ADR index are generated but committed: run
   `task docs`, and `task check:docs` fails when they are stale.
2. **No remote `$ref`.** Every bundle resolves every reference inside its own
   `$defs`. `task check:schema` rejects a remote one.
3. **No behavioural change without conformance cases** in the same family
   version's `conformance/`. A rule a document can violate carries a requirement
   ID, and `task check:conformance` fails on any declared ID or diagnostic code
   that no case pins and no runner exclusion explains.
4. **Shared rules live in core.** A family cites `CORE-*` requirements and core
   clauses. It never restates an envelope, YAML-profile, validation-phase or
   shared-diagnostic rule. What core is:
   [How the families relate](../specifications/README.md#how-the-families-relate).
   See docs/adr/0022.
5. **Validation never becomes stricter inside a major version.** A breaking
   change needs a new `v<N>` directory, *except* inside ADR 0005 §1's
   pre-publication window. That window drops the directory and the migration
   note, but not maintainer approval or the breaking-change declaration.
   `git tag -l '<family>/*'` decides which case applies, and `task check:compat`
   guards every released version.
6. **Released bytes never change.** `published.json`, the
   [ledger](../docs/publication.md#the-ledger) (version 2), is append-only. The
   release pull request writes it through `task release:record`. That nobody
   edits it by hand is a convention, not a check, but `task check:published`
   fails a pending entry that differs from a fresh derivation, and
   `task check:ledger` rejects any edit to an entry the base branch holds. Release tags are never moved or deleted
   (`.github/rulesets/release-tags.json`). Pinned URLs serve verified immutable
   release assets, never `main` (`task check:published`, `task site:fetch`).
   See docs/adr/0006 and docs/adr/0023.
7. **Data artifacts only.** No executables and no generated language bindings.
   See docs/governance.md → Binary policy.
8. **Paths come from `tools/src/lib/layout.ts`.** No other tool spells a
   repository path, and a guard test in `tools/src/lib/layout.test.ts` fails if
   one does. A tool reading a released ref fails, rather than returning nothing,
   when a path the layout names is absent. See docs/adr/0021 §3.
9. **Tool configuration lives in `.config/<concern>/`, passed by path.** Never
   add a config to the repo root when the tool accepts a config flag, and never
   rely on default discovery. `task check:conventions` enforces this
   (CONF-01..CONF-09), and `task check:config` (CFG-09) holds the repository
   root to `ROOT_ENTRIES` in `tools/src/lib/layout.ts`. See docs/adr/0011,
   docs/adr/0024 and docs/adr/0037.
10. **Review is a code-owner gate, not a blanket approval.** A pull request
    touching no path in `.github/CODEOWNERS` merges on green CI. The two halves
    are `required_approving_review_count: 0` plus
    `require_code_owner_review: true`, and a CODEOWNERS with no `*` catch-all.
    Each is useless without the other and both break silently, so never change
    one without the other. `task check:rulesets` enforces this (RUL-01..RUL-08).
    See docs/adr/0015.
11. **Structural changes need an accepted ADR first.** An accepted ADR changes
    only by link-target maintenance: a relative link whose target moved may be
    retargeted, and nothing else may change. `task check:adr` blanks only
    relative link targets and compares absolute URLs verbatim, so it fails any
    other diff. Whether the target really moved is a review obligation, not a
    check. See docs/adr/0021 §4.
12. **release-please assigns commits by path, not by scope.** A `feat`, `fix` or
    `docs` commit under `specifications/<family>/v<N>/` enters that family's
    next release, whatever its scope says. Use `refactor`, `chore`, `test`,
    `ci` or `build` for a change there that should release nothing. `main`
    squash-merges under the pull request title, so a pull request carrying more
    than one type of change lists them in a `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` block, with
    one exception for `specifications/core/`:
    [CONTRIBUTING → Squash merges and overrides](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#squash-merges-and-overrides).

`spec.md` states the definitive rule. Schema `description` text, examples and
the generated `/reference/` pages are informative; see
[What is normative](../specifications/README.md#what-is-normative).

## Where things are

- [Anatomy of a family version](../specifications/README.md#anatomy): what
  `specifications/<family>/v<N>/` holds
- [Repository conventions](../docs/conventions.md): naming for directories,
  modules, `$id`s and case IDs. Field and value naming is
  [ADR 0007](../docs/adr/0007-naming-conventions.md)
- [Contributing](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md): making a change, commit types, sign-off
- [Tools](../tools/README.md): what each `task check` step enforces
- [Publication](../docs/publication.md): releases, the ledger, the core gate and
  cache policy
- [Fixture format](../docs/conformance.md), shared by every corpus
- [Governance](../docs/governance.md): compatibility, release and binary policy
- [Decision records](../docs/adr/README.md)

## Commits

Conventional Commits, DCO-signed:

```sh
git commit -s -m "feat(component): add restartPolicy"
