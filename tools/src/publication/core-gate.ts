/**
 * The core gate: a kind family release waits for core's releasable changes
 * (docs/adr/0022 §7, docs/adr/0023 §5).
 *
 * A kind family release records `requires.core`, the core edition it was built
 * and tested against, and ships that edition's prose and corpus. If core carries
 * a releasable change that edition does not include, the record would name
 * rules the family was not tested against. So:
 *
 *   pending   core's manifest must have released; `core/v<requires.core>` must
 *             exist; and no releasable commit may touch core since that tag.
 *             A non-releasable core commit warns — release-please opens no core
 *             release for it, so blocking would deadlock every kind family on
 *             the one change that alters no rule.
 *   tagged    `core/v<requires.core>` must be an ancestor of the family tag.
 *             That is all `check:published` asks of history. `release:stage`,
 *             on the tag's own tooling, also requires no releasable core commit
 *             between them and its major to be the core line the family's §2
 *             cites — classification is never re-run by newer tooling.
 *
 * A commit is releasable when its type is one release-please's changelog shows,
 * read from the same configuration release-please reads, when it is breaking,
 * or when its trailer block carries `Release-As:`.
 * The gate reads `git log`, not a pull request body, so a
 * `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` is invisible to it; ADR 0023 §5 makes not using one on
 * core a review obligation.
 *
 * `bun core-gate.ts` is `task check:editions`.
 *
 * NON-NORMATIVE, like everything under tools/.
