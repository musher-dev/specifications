/**
 * Detect `.config/` layout drift.
 *
 * Tool configuration lives in one place, and every caller names its config
 * with the tool's own flag. That convention is worth exactly as much as its
 * enforcement: `musher-dev/platform` shipped the prose version of this rule
 * with no mechanical gate, and in that state two non-configs accreted inside
 * the directory and four lint tools quietly ran on defaults. The rules below are
 * what stops the same drift here.
 *
 * Two of them earn their place by catching failures that are silent rather
 * than loud. CFG-06: lefthook's config search is first-match-wins over
 * `lefthook.*` → `.lefthook.*` → `.config/lefthook.*`, so a stray root file
 * shadows this directory's copy with no warning — a different set of hooks
 * runs and nothing says so. CFG-04: a config nothing reads still reads as
 * authoritative to the next person to open it.
 *
 * The codes are shared with `musher-dev/development-container` and
 * `musher-dev/platform`, which run the same rules from a Python CLI. Three
 * repositories, one convention, one vocabulary for reporting a breach of it.
 *
 * CFG-09 is this repository's own: the root holds only the entries
 * `ROOT_ENTRIES` names (docs/adr/0024), so a leftover or a stray file fails
 * rather than accreting one commit at a time.
 *
 * NON-NORMATIVE, like everything under tools/.
