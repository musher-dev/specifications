/**
 * Record pending releases in `published.json` — `task release:record`.
 *
 * Runs on a release-please pull request branch, before the tag exists.
 * `.github/rulesets/main-branch.json` allows only squash merges of an
 * up-to-date branch, so the merge commit's tree is the head's tree and an entry
 * written here describes the commit that gets tagged (docs/adr/0023 §3).
 *
 * For each manifest version that is not tagged it writes `path`, `tree` (git's
 * tree id of the family version directory at HEAD), `bundleSha256` (the pinned
 * bundle built from HEAD, null for core) and, for a kind family,
 * `requires` (exact manifest versions of its declared dependencies). It inserts or updates such pending
 * entries — a branch updated from `main` is re-recorded, not left stale — and
 * never rewrites an entry whose tag exists.
 *
 * The dependency gates run before anything is written.
 *
 * NON-NORMATIVE, like everything under tools/.
