# Musher Document Core Specification — Specification v1

**Status:** Draft (pre-stable)
**Family:** `core`

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and
[RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

> **What is normative.** This document defines the behaviour every Musher
> document family shares. It publishes no JSON Schema of its own
> ([§10](#known-debt)): each family's bundle is the executable form of that
> family's structural validity, and states this document's envelope rules for
> that family's documents. The [conformance corpus](../../../docs/conformance.md)
> — this document's own, and each family's — is the executable form for
> observable outcomes. This document, the corpora, and each family schema where
> it states a rule of this document are normative, and none is permitted to
> disagree with another. Examples, generated documentation, and validator
> message text are informative.
>
> A disagreement between two normative artifacts is a defect in this
> specification and blocks a release. Until it is fixed this document governs —
> but that is how to read a broken contract, not a licence for a schema or a
> fixture to be wrong.

## <a id="scope"></a>1. Scope

The **Musher Document Core Specification** states the rules every Musher
document family shares: the document envelope, version compatibility, the
catalog item, the identifier grammars more than one family uses, the validation
layers and the YAML profile, the shared diagnostic codes, what a conformance
claim covers, and the security considerations every document raises.

It defines no `kind`. No document declares this specification, and no document
is validated against it alone. A document belongs to a family — today
[component](../../component/v1/spec.md), [blueprint](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md)
or [listing](../../listing/v1/spec.md) — and that family's specification applies
this one, binding the parameters [§1.1](#bindings) leaves open.

A family specification cites a clause of this document by its major line and
section, as `core v1 §6.1`, and always as a link to the clause's anchor
([§9](#editions)).

**Out of scope for this document**

- Every field inside `metadata` and `spec` → the family specification
- The JSON Schema a document is validated against → the family's bundle
- Runtime state, instances, and endpoints → the Musher API

### <a id="bindings"></a>1.1 Bindings

This document leaves some parameters to the family that applies it. A family
specification MUST bind each of them in its §2, in a table whose first column is
headed "Core parameter":

| Core parameter | What the family states | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | The constant its documents declare. | [`CORE-ENV-002`](#CORE-ENV-002) |
| `metadata` | The section defining its `metadata` object: its identity fields and any description it requires. | [`CORE-ENV-003`](#CORE-ENV-003) |
| Fields accepting `null` | Each field that accepts `null`, with the section that justifies it, or that there are none. | [`CORE-ENV-007`](#CORE-ENV-007) |
| Item document | The file name its document takes at an item root, or that its documents sit inside an item rather than naming one. | [§4.1](#item-directory) |

A family specification MUST also declare its **normative dependencies**, in a
table headed "Normative dependencies" that follows the bindings table and names
each specification whose rules the family applies, with the major line it
applies. Every family names core. A family that applies a rule another family
defines names that family too. A family's diagnostic registry comprises its own
table, core's ([§7](#diagnostics)), and those of the families it declares as
dependencies. Tooling reads the table, so it stays a table.

A family specification narrows this document where it says so and relaxes it
nowhere.

### <a id="admission"></a>1.2 Admission

This section is informative. The test is decided in
[ADR 0022](../../../docs/adr/0022-the-musher-document-core-specification.md) §2,
and restated here so a reader proposing a rule can apply it.

A rule belongs in this document only when **all three** of these hold:

1. **It can be stated without naming a kind.** A rule that names `COMPONENT`
   cannot bind a family that has no components.
2. **At least two families apply it.** A rule only one family applies is that
   family's rule under another name.
3. **Within the major version, it can only grow by addition.** A release of this
   document reaches every family at once, so narrowing one of its rules is a new
   major of every family.

A rule that looks shared can still fail the first condition. Component's value
shapes are applied by component and by blueprint, and they stay in
[component §6.3](../../component/v1/spec.md#value-schema): they are the grammar
of a block only a component defines, and blueprint reaches them through its
declared dependency on component.

## <a id="envelope"></a>2. Document envelope

Every Musher specification document shares one envelope:

```yaml
specVersion: v1
kind: <KIND>
metadata: { … }
spec: { … }
```

| ID | Field | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| <a id="CORE-ENV-001"></a>`CORE-ENV-001` | `specVersion` | REQUIRED. Declares the document-format compatibility family, independent of any API URL version. |
| <a id="CORE-ENV-002"></a>`CORE-ENV-002` | `kind` | REQUIRED. MUST be the constant the family specification binds ([§1.1](#bindings)). |
| <a id="CORE-ENV-003"></a>`CORE-ENV-003` | `metadata` | REQUIRED. Identity, and any description the family binds. |
| <a id="CORE-ENV-004"></a>`CORE-ENV-004` | `spec` | REQUIRED. The definition itself. |

<a id="CORE-ENV-005"></a>**`CORE-ENV-005`** — Unknown properties MUST be
rejected with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FIELD` at every level, not only at the root of the
envelope. A misspelled field is an error, never a silently ignored one —
including when the misspelled field is optional, where ignoring it would
silently substitute the default. A property that *is* defined, by a schema
release the validator does not hold, is the same error for a reason
[§3](#compatibility) gives.

<a id="CORE-ENV-006"></a>**`CORE-ENV-006`** — A validator encountering a
`specVersion` it does not support MUST reject the document with
`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_VERSION` and MUST NOT attempt a best-effort
interpretation.

<a id="CORE-ENV-007"></a>**`CORE-ENV-007` — an optional field is omitted,
not written `null`.** A field accepts `null` only where `null` means something
omission does not, and a family specification names each field that accepts
`null` ([§1.1](#bindings)). A field written `null` outside those places is
rejected in the `structural` phase with `ERR_INVALID_TYPE`. This rule is here
rather than beside each field because it is a property of the whole contract: a
three-state field — absent, `null`, present — modelling a two-state idea is
three states in every SDK generated from a family's schema, forever, and nothing
reads the third.

> **Note.** This envelope is deliberately not a Kubernetes-style
> `apiVersion: <group>/<version>`. `specVersion` is Musher's document-format
> discriminator and one convention beats two. See
> [ADR 0001](../../../docs/adr/0001-canonical-repository-architecture.md).

## <a id="compatibility"></a>3. Version compatibility

For the same document and pinned external context, a compatible release MUST
preserve acceptance and defined meaning: defaults, binding recipients, reference
selection, encodings and sensitivity. Moving a check between structural and
semantic phases does not alter this guarantee. Changing operational admission
policy is separate and MUST NOT silently rewrite document meaning.

`specVersion: v1` declares a **compatibility family**, not an exact schema. A
validator MUST evaluate the document against the newest `v1.x.y` schema release
it holds.

Within a major version, validation MUST NOT become stricter. A document that
validated against `v1.0.0` MUST validate against every later `v1.x.y`.

**A validator MUST reject unsupported constructs.** A document using only its
supported subset may be accepted even when authored against a newer release.
A field introduced in `v1.3.0` is, to a validator holding
`v1.1.0`, a property the schema does not define, and it is rejected in the
`structural` phase with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FIELD` like any other. A validator MUST NOT
ignore, strip, or pass through a property it cannot evaluate, and MUST NOT relax
the rule on a claim that the property is new — no such claim is verifiable.

**The code is `ERR_UNKNOWN_FIELD` because the validator cannot tell the two
cases apart.** `specVersion` names the family, not the release, so nothing in
the document says which release it was written against. A field from a later
release and a misspelling are the same bytes to a validator that holds neither
definition. A code that said so — `ERR_SCHEMA_TOO_OLD` — would require the
validator to know what it is missing, which is precisely what it does not have.

**Guessing is the failure [§2](#envelope) exists to prevent.** Ignoring a
misspelled optional field silently substitutes the default; a field from a newer
release is that hazard with a worse ending. The author wrote it, the schema
defining it exists, and the only party who cannot see it is the validator. A
document rejected for a field the operator can look up is recoverable. A
document accepted with that field dropped is not.

Because the diagnostic cannot name the cause, the implementation is where an
operator has to find it. An implementation SHOULD make the schema release it
evaluated against discoverable — in the diagnostic, in a `--version`-style
output, or both — and SHOULD name updating the validator among the remedies.
Message text is not normative ([§7](#diagnostics)), so this is a recommendation
about what an implementation surfaces, not about the words it chooses.

**Why the release is not pinned in the document.** Letting `specVersion` carry
`v1.3.0` would turn this failure into `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_VERSION`, which
names the cause exactly. That alternative is still rejected. `specVersion` is
the document-format discriminator and declaring a family is the whole of its
job ([§2](#envelope)); pinning a release there asks every author to name a
floor they have no way to know, and makes a document that would validate
everywhere fail against the releases it never needed.

**The guarantee runs one way.** An old document validates against a new
validator; a new document does not validate against an old one. A field added in
`v1.N.0` is therefore usable only where the consumer holds `v1.N.0` or later,
and a document that must validate everywhere is written against the oldest
release its consumers hold.

## <a id="items"></a>4. Items

Some rules are about a document's surroundings rather than its contents: that
its slug matches the directory holding it, that a path stays inside that
directory, that a sibling a family expects is beside it. This section defines
the surroundings those rules are measured against, once, and states the one of
them that every family shares.

### <a id="item-directory"></a>4.1 The item directory

A document does not always travel alone. Documents that belong together — a
blueprint and its sibling listing, for example — belong to a **catalog item**:
one directory holding one deployable thing.

An **item document** is a document whose file name its family specification
binds ([§1.1](#bindings)). The directory containing an item document is the
**item root**. It is what [§4.2](#item-identity)'s rule is measured against,
and what a family's rules about paths inside an item are measured against.

**Item documents are siblings.** An item holding more than one item document
holds them in the same directory, so the directory containing one is the
directory containing the others, and an item has one item root however many
item documents it holds. A document whose family names no item document sits
inside an item rather than at its root, and has no item root of its own.

**A document with no directory has no item root.** Every rule measured against
an item root needs one, so an implementation handed a document rather than a
directory MUST NOT report any of them. It has not been given the means to check,
and a diagnostic it cannot substantiate is worse than a silence.

### <a id="item-identity"></a>4.2 Item identity

One rule binds an item document to the item holding it. It is `semantic`, it is
measured against the item root [§4.1](#item-directory) defines, and it reads a
field the item document's family defines in its `metadata`.

| ID | Rule | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| <a id="CORE-ITEM-001"></a>`CORE-ITEM-001` | An item document's `metadata.slug` MUST equal the item directory name. | `ERR_SLUG_MISMATCH` |

A document handed over with no directory has no item root, and
[§4.1](#item-directory) says what that means for this rule.

**The item, not its siblings, is what an item document is measured against.**
An item's documents agree on their identity because each agrees with the one
directory holding them, never by being compared with one another. Nothing here
requires an item to hold any particular item document, or two of them to agree
on anything beyond the name they share with their directory. What a family's
other `metadata` fields count is that family's to say:
[blueprint §3](../../blueprint/v1/spec.md#identity) says what an item's revision
counts, and [component §4](../../component/v1/spec.md#metadata) says why a
component's is a different number.

## <a id="grammars"></a>5. Identifier grammars

A grammar named here is used by more than one family, and is stated once. A
family that uses one cites it. Schema sources reference generated shared grammar
definitions; the deterministic bundler embeds those definitions into each
self-contained publication. Families do not independently maintain the patterns.

### <a id="label-grammar"></a>5.1 The label grammar

A **label** matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9]$`: a lowercase letter, then
up to sixty-one lowercase letters, digits or hyphens, then a lowercase letter or
a digit. It is a DNS label, two to sixty-three characters long, and it is the
grammar [ADR 0007](../../../docs/adr/0007-naming-conventions.md) §4 gives an
identifier that is composed into a host name or materialised under its own name.
`metadata.slug`, a blueprint node name and a component volume name all take it.

The grammar carries no requirement ID. The rule a document violates is its
family's rule that a field takes the grammar, and a value outside it is rejected
in the `structural` phase with `ERR_INVALID_VALUE`.

### <a id="reference-grammar"></a>5.2 The reference grammar

A **reference** names a fact this document cannot contain. It is written
`${{ <namespace>.<path> }}`, and it stands where a value would stand:

```yaml
template: "https://${{ self.endpoints.web.publicHostname }}/oauth/cb"
```

A document is sealed before the thing it describes exists. The address that
deployment will answer on is assigned afterwards, so no author can write it
down, and no field can carry it. A reference is how a document names it anyway.

References use single-pass substitution, without functions, operators,
conditionals, arithmetic, recursive expansion or fallback expressions.
Families explicitly identify the permitted positions and namespaces.

**The grammar.** A reference is `${{`, optional whitespace, a namespace, one or
more `.`-separated segments, optional whitespace, and `}}`. A namespace is one
of the names this section reserves. A segment matches `^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`,
which admits every name the identifier grammars
[ADR 0007](../../../docs/adr/0007-naming-conventions.md) §4 gives a referable
thing, and excludes `.`, so a dotted path is read one way. Whitespace inside the
braces is insignificant; this specification and the examples write one space
inside each brace pair.

**The escape.** `$${{` is the only escape. It is a single four-character token
rendering a literal `${{`, and not per-`$` doubling. A `$` that begins neither
`${{` nor `$${{` is literal and needs no escape.

**What a reference yields.** A reference occupying a whole value yields the
value it names. A reference with text around it yields that value's string form,
joined with the surrounding text. Whole references preserve logical types. Families define where string
composition is permitted and the encoding used there.

**A resolved value is never scanned again.** The text a reference yields is
substituted, and a `${{` within it is literal. Substitution is non-recursive. This does not eliminate value dependencies
between explicit input and output bindings; their ordering belongs to blueprint.

**Where a reference may be written.** Nowhere, unless a family says so. A family
opens a named position and names the namespaces admitted there, and a reference
anywhere else is text. No family may open a position whose value decides
identity or drives resolution itself — a `kind`, a `specVersion`, a mapping key,
or a reference to another document — because a reference there would have to be
resolved before the document could be read.

<a id="CORE-REF-001"></a>**`CORE-REF-001`** — In a position a family opens to
references, an unescaped `${{` MUST begin a well-formed reference. A malformed
one is rejected in the `semantic` phase with `ERR_MALFORMED_REFERENCE`.

An unclosed `${{`, a namespace with no path, and a path with no namespace are
each one keystroke from a reference an author meant to write. Treating them as
text carries the mistake through validation, through publication, and into the
deployed thing as the literal characters, where it is discovered by whatever
reads the value and fails.

<a id="CORE-REF-002"></a>**`CORE-REF-002`** — A reference's namespace MUST be
one this section reserves. `semantic`, `ERR_UNKNOWN_REFERENCE_NAMESPACE`.

<a id="CORE-REF-003"></a>**`CORE-REF-003`** — A reference's namespace MUST be
one the family admits at that position. `semantic`,
`ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_IN_SCOPE`.

**The reserved namespaces.** The set is closed. An author cannot extend it, and
a family admits names from it rather than adding to it.

| Namespace | Names | v1 |
|---|---|---|
| `self` | The addressing of the thing the value is bound to. | Defined by the family that admits it. |
| `parameters` | A value supplied when a composition is installed. | Reserved. |
| `variables` | An organization variable, as visible to the environment an installation deploys into. | Defined by blueprint parameters' `from`. |
| `connections` | An atomic connection: endpoint, credential and model selected together. | Defined by blueprint parameters' `from`. |
| `deployment` | Facts about a deployment. | Reserved. |
| `environment` | Facts about a target environment. | Reserved. |
| `organization` | Facts about an owning organization. | Reserved. |
| `output` | A value another node publishes. | Reserved. |

A **reserved** namespace has no meaning in any document of any family at this
line, and no family admits one, so writing it is `CORE-REF-003`. Reserving it is
what keeps it from ever becoming a name an author can address. The set may grow
by addition within this major version; a name in it may be given a meaning, and
no name leaves it.

Namespaces name a concept and never a vendor. A closed set has nothing to
collide with, so the convention that prefixes a flat keyspace does not apply
here.

**A diagnostic quotes the reference, never the value.** An implementation
reporting any of the three rules above MUST reproduce the reference as written
and MUST NOT include a value it resolved or attempted to resolve, on the terms
[§11](#security) sets for resolved configuration values. Behavioural conformance fixtures exercise implementation obligations.

## <a id="validation-layers"></a>6. Validation layers

Structural validation is one layer of four. An implementation MUST apply them
in order and MUST NOT report a later-layer diagnostic before the earlier layers
pass.

| Phase | Enforces | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `parser` | The Musher YAML profile — [§6.1](#yaml-profile). | Client and server |
| `structural` | The family's JSON Schema 2020-12 document. | Client and server |
| `semantic` | Rules JSON Schema cannot express — reference resolution, path containment, uniqueness across collections. | Client and server |
| `capability` | Account, region, and quota checks. | Server only |

An evaluator MUST NOT access the network in the `parser`, `structural`, or
`semantic` phases. An authorized resolver acquires dependencies separately and
supplies pinned context; catalog-backed facts can then be checked offline.

**Why the `parser` phase rejects legal YAML.** A duplicate key, an anchor and
an alias are all well-formed YAML 1.2, and all three are rejected here.

A duplicate key has no defined winner: parsers disagree on whether the first or
the last survives, so a document carrying one means two things. An alias means
one thing, but only after expansion, and a document whose meaning depends on
being expanded is not readable as the thing it declares — the same reason
[§2](#envelope) rejects a misspelled optional field rather than ignoring it. An
anchor with no alias is inert, and is rejected anyway: an author who writes one
is reaching for a feature this contract does not have, and finding that out at
authoring time is better than finding it out when the alias is added.

The bound also matters. Alias expansion is where a small document becomes a
large one — the billion-laughs shape — and a validator that must expand before
it can measure has no way to refuse cheaply.

`ERR_ANCHOR_OR_ALIAS` is separate from `ERR_INVALID_YAML` because the two say
different things to an author. One means the document is malformed; the other
means it is well-formed and uses something this contract withholds.

### <a id="coverage"></a>6.0 Validation coverage

Results carry status (VALID, INVALID or INCOMPLETE), `validationProfile`, reached
phase, diagnostics and deferred obligations. `validationProfile` names the core
validation obligations, separately from an implementation conformance profile or
a behavioural fixture profile. Each deferred obligation identifies
its rule, document pointer and missing context. Known failure takes precedence
over incompleteness. VALID means all obligations required by the claimed profile
completed. No caller may interpret INCOMPLETE as approval.

Profiles are structural (parser and schema), document (including semantic
obligations), publication (document plus catalog/publication admission), and
deployment (publication plus installation resolution and current policy).
Document validation without required item or dependency context is INCOMPLETE.

<a id="CORE-ADMISSION-001"></a>**`CORE-ADMISSION-001`** — Publication and deployment
MUST complete all respective deferred obligations before admission. Synthetic
catalog/account fixtures may exercise these checks offline; a production
implementation still acquires and verifies its own authorized context.

### <a id="yaml-profile"></a>6.1 The Musher YAML profile

Musher documents are written in a **restricted profile of
[YAML 1.2.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/)**, not in unrestricted YAML. This
section is that profile, and it governs every family built on this document — a
family specification inherits it rather than restating it.

Every restriction below withholds something YAML 1.2.2 permits. The reason is
uniform, and it is the one [§2](#envelope) gives for rejecting a misspelled
optional field: a document that means different things to different readers, or
that cannot be judged without unbounded work, is not a contract. A feature is
therefore withheld when it is *legal but ambiguous*, not when it is merely
unusual.

**Encoding and framing**

| ID | Rule | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| <a id="CORE-YAML-001"></a>`CORE-YAML-001` | A document MUST be encoded in UTF-8. Malformed UTF-8 is rejected before replacement decoding. | `ERR_INVALID_UTF8` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-002"></a>`CORE-YAML-002` | A document MAY begin with a UTF-8 byte order mark. It carries no meaning and MUST be ignored. | — |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-003"></a>`CORE-YAML-003` | Line endings MAY be LF or CRLF, and carry no meaning. | — |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-004"></a>`CORE-YAML-004` | A file MUST contain exactly one YAML document. The `---` and `...` markers MAY be present; a stream carrying more than one document is rejected. | `ERR_MULTIPLE_DOCUMENTS` |

A file holding two documents has no answer to "which one is the document", and
picking the first silently discards a thing the author wrote.

**Structure**

| ID | Rule | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| <a id="CORE-YAML-005"></a>`CORE-YAML-005` | Every mapping key MUST be a string. A numeric, boolean, null, or complex key is rejected. | `ERR_NON_STRING_KEY` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-006"></a>`CORE-YAML-006` | A mapping key MUST NOT appear twice. | `ERR_DUPLICATE_KEY` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-007"></a>`CORE-YAML-007` | A document MUST NOT declare an anchor or an alias. | `ERR_ANCHOR_OR_ALIAS` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-008"></a>`CORE-YAML-008` | A document MUST NOT use a merge key (`<<`). | `ERR_MERGE_KEY` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-009"></a>`CORE-YAML-009` | A node MUST NOT carry an explicit tag — neither a custom tag (`!secret`) nor a core-schema tag (`!!str`). | `ERR_EXPLICIT_TAG` |

Mapping keys are property names in every schema this repository publishes, and
`1:` resolving to the integer one on one parser and the string `"1"` on another
is the duplicate-key problem wearing a different hat.

A merge key is an alias by another name and is withheld for the same reason.
It is named separately because `<<` reads as a key rather than as a reference,
so an author who writes one is not told about aliases; they are told about `<<`.

An explicit tag overrides scalar resolution, and scalar resolution is exactly
what this profile fixes below. `!!str 5` and `5` differ only in a tag, and a
contract in which the type of a value depends on an annotation beside it has no
stable reading.

**Scalar resolution**

Scalars resolve by the **YAML 1.2 core schema**, and by nothing else. `true`
and `false` are booleans; `null` and `~` are null; `on`, `off`, `yes`, and `no`
are strings, as YAML 1.2 requires and YAML 1.1 did not. A value whose intended
type is not the resolved one MUST be quoted.

This is the one place where naming the version does real work: a YAML 1.1
parser reads `no` as boolean false, and a `country: no` in a document read by
both is two different documents.

**Bounds**

An implementation MUST reject a document exceeding any of these, and MUST accept
one that does not:

| ID | Bound | Limit | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="CORE-YAML-010"></a>`CORE-YAML-010` | Document size | 1 MiB (1 048 576 bytes) | `ERR_DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-011"></a>`CORE-YAML-011` | Nesting depth | 64 levels | `ERR_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` |
| <a id="CORE-YAML-012"></a>`CORE-YAML-012` | Scalar length | 64 KiB (65 536 bytes) | `ERR_SCALAR_TOO_LONG` |

The bounds are stated rather than left to implementations because "be sensible"
is not a bound: a document one validator accepts and another refuses on size is
not one contract, and an author has no way to discover the limit except by
exceeding it somewhere.

Each is far above any document a person writes and far below what makes a
parser a denial-of-service surface. Document size MUST be measured before
parsing — a limit a parser can apply only after building the tree is not a limit
on the work it does. The alias ban already removes the billion-laughs shape;
these bound the cases it does not cover.

**What carries no meaning**

Key order, comments, indentation width, quoting style, and flow-versus-block
form are all presentation. Two documents differing only in these are the same
document, and an implementation MUST NOT derive meaning from any of them.

Because YAML 1.2 is a superset of JSON, a document written as JSON is a valid
Musher document and is read identically.

The byte boundary MUST use fatal UTF-8 decoding. Parser/profile errors and
representation depth are checked before conversion to JSON; aliases are never
expanded. Implementations return diagnostics rather than conversion exceptions.
Non-finite numbers and integers outside ±9007199254740991 are rejected.
Other numbers use finite binary64 representation. Logical values may contain
null when explicitly admitted by their value schema; this is separate from
optional document-field omission.

### <a id="format-policy"></a>6.2 The `format` keyword

This clause is about the JSON Schema **keyword** `format`, not about any field
named `format` a family defines. The two are unrelated: such a field is the
family's, with its own rules, and no schema this repository publishes uses the
keyword at all.

Should one ever appear, `format` is an **annotation and asserts nothing**. That
is the JSON Schema 2020-12 default rather than a shortcut: `format` constrains a
value only where the Format Assertion vocabulary is explicitly declared, and no
Musher schema declares it.

A validator MUST NOT reject a document because a value fails a `format`
keyword, and MUST NOT accept one it would otherwise reject because a value
satisfies one.

The reason is portability. `format` implementations differ — one library's
`uri` accepts what another's rejects, and `email` is worse — so a schema that
depended on `format` for rejection would validate differently depending on which
library a consumer happened to link. A rule that must hold everywhere is written
with an assertion keyword instead: `pattern`, `enum`, `minLength`, `const`. Where
a rule cannot be expressed that way, it belongs to the `semantic` phase and
carries a diagnostic of its own.

Adopting the Format Assertion vocabulary later would make previously valid
documents invalid, so it is a breaking change and needs an ADR.

## <a id="diagnostics"></a>7. Diagnostics

Diagnostic **codes** and the **phase** at which validation fails are normative.
Human-readable messages are not — implementations in different languages emit
different text and that is expected. A code identifies a condition and its registry
lists all permitted phases. A diagnostic reports the actual phase where the
condition was found. Resolution diagnostics additionally identify the stage:
parameters, allocation, connections, values, environment or record. Successful
value resolution establishes no current authorization, quota or placement grant.

A diagnostic's primary `path` is a JSON Pointer into the submitted document.
Cross-document diagnostics anchor at an authored binding or `componentRef` and
carry `related` locations with an `artifact` reference and its actual `path`.
Missing component inputs anchor at `componentRef`; implementations MUST NOT invent
blueprint output fields or absent binding fields as diagnostic locations.
Human-readable messages and related artifact labels MUST NOT expose secret values.

The codes below apply to every document of every family. A family
specification's diagnostics table adds codes to them, and MUST NOT declare one
of them again: a code declared in two tables can be given two meanings, and one
code names one condition.

| Code | Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR_INVALID_YAML` | `parser` | The document is not well-formed YAML 1.2. |
| `ERR_INVALID_UTF8` | `parser` | Original bytes are malformed UTF-8. |
| `ERR_INVALID_NUMBER` | `parser` | A numeric scalar is non-finite or an unsafe integer. |
| `ERR_DUPLICATE_KEY` | `parser` | The same mapping key appears twice. |
| `ERR_ANCHOR_OR_ALIAS` | `parser` | The document declares a YAML anchor or an alias. |
| `ERR_MULTIPLE_DOCUMENTS` | `parser` | The file carries more than one YAML document. |
| `ERR_NON_STRING_KEY` | `parser` | A mapping key is not a string. |
| `ERR_MERGE_KEY` | `parser` | The document uses a merge key (`<<`). |
| `ERR_EXPLICIT_TAG` | `parser` | A node carries an explicit YAML tag. |
| `ERR_DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE` | `parser` | The document exceeds the size bound in [§6.1](#yaml-profile). |
| `ERR_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` | `parser` | The document nests deeper than [§6.1](#yaml-profile) permits. |
| `ERR_SCALAR_TOO_LONG` | `parser` | A scalar exceeds the length bound in [§6.1](#yaml-profile). |
| `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_VERSION` | `structural` | `specVersion` is not a supported value. |
| `ERR_WRONG_KIND` | `structural` | `kind` does not match the family being validated. |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_FIELD` | `structural` | A property not defined by the schema is present. |
| `ERR_MISSING_FIELD` | `structural` | A required property is absent. |
| `ERR_INVALID_TYPE` | `structural` | A value has the wrong type. |
| `ERR_INVALID_VALUE` | `structural` | A value violates a pattern, enum, or bound. |
| `ERR_SLUG_MISMATCH` | `semantic` | `metadata.slug` disagrees with the item directory name. |
| `ERR_MALFORMED_REFERENCE` | `semantic` | An unescaped `${{` does not begin a well-formed reference ([§5.2](#reference-grammar)). |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_REFERENCE_NAMESPACE` | `semantic` | A reference names a namespace [§5.2](#reference-grammar) does not reserve. |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_IN_SCOPE` | `semantic` | A reference names a reserved namespace the family does not admit at that position. |

## <a id="conformance"></a>8. Conformance

**A claim to conform to a family release covers two sets of cases**: the
release's own corpus, and the core corpus ([§8.1](#core-corpus)) at the core
edition the release records ([§9](#editions)). An implementation conforms when
it produces the declared outcome for every case in both, and MUST pass both
under its declared profile. It MAY also run a later core v1 corpus, and MUST NOT
substitute one for the other.

Implementations MUST run the fixture corpus in their own CI. Passing a fixture
that is declared to fail is a conformance failure.

An implementation MUST declare the **profile** it claims. Conformance is not a
single claim: `capability` needs an account, a region, and a quota, so an
implementation a user runs locally cannot reach it, and an editor integration
that checks structure is a useful thing to be without being a control plane.
The profiles, and the report shape a claim should take, are defined in
[docs/conformance.md](../../../docs/conformance.md#profiles).

A skipped case is never a passed one. An implementation MUST NOT claim a
profile while skipping any case in a phase that profile requires.

### <a id="core-corpus"></a>8.1 The core corpus

The core corpus is [`specifications/core/v1/conformance/`](conformance/), and it
holds `parser` cases only. A `structural` case needs a schema, and this document
publishes none; a case about an item needs a document of some family inside a
directory.

An adapter runs a core case through its parser alone. `expected: pass` means the
parser accepts the document, and no later phase runs. A core case's document
need not be a valid envelope, because no later phase reads it. Where it carries a
`kind`, that value is `COMPONENT` and has no effect, and an adapter MUST NOT
dispatch on it. The parser runs before a family is chosen, so an
implementation covering several families runs the core corpus once — once per
parser, where it has more than one.

Each family's corpus keeps one `parser` case, `parser-001-reject-duplicate-keys`.
It shows that the family's pipeline applies the profile at all. It does not show
that the pipeline applies all of it, which is what the core corpus is for.

## <a id="editions"></a>9. Editions

This document has its own release line, tagged `core/vX.Y.Z` as each family's
is. One release of it is an **edition**.

**A family cites the line, not the edition.** A family specification cites this
document as "core v1 §N" and never names an exact edition in prose: an edition
in prose would turn every core patch release into a prose edit in every family.
Every citation MUST be a link to the clause's anchor. A section number standing
alone is read as a section of the document it appears in, so an unlinked
`core v1 §6.1` in a family specification points a reader at the family's own
§6.1.

**A family release records the edition.** Each release of a family records the
core edition it was built and tested against, and carries that edition's
`spec.md` and corpus with it. A conformance claim against the release names that
edition ([§8](#conformance)), so the two corpora the claim names both exist and
were tested together. How the edition is recorded, the checks that hold a
family release while this document has unreleased releasable changes, and why
its other unreleased changes only warn, are set out in
[ADR 0023](../../../docs/adr/0023-published-bytes-are-immutable-release-assets.md).

**What a release of this document may change.** This paragraph is informative:
it records this repository's release policy. Within v1, a minor release of this
document adds a clause, a case or a relaxation, and adds a code only for a
condition an earlier v1 edition already rejects. No release rejects a document
an earlier v1 edition accepted — [§3](#compatibility) applied to every family at
once, which is why [§1.2](#admission) admits only rules that grow by addition.
A rule that needs narrowing is core v2, a new line that each family adopts in a
major release of its own.

## <a id="known-debt"></a>10. Boundaries and unsupported capabilities

**No core schema.** This document publishes no JSON Schema. Each family's bundle
states the envelope for its own documents, and
[ADR 0022](../../../docs/adr/0022-the-musher-document-core-specification.md) §5
records why neither available shape of a shared schema was worth publishing.
Adding one later rejects no document and is additive.

**Family dispatch.** After parser validation, a dispatcher rejects an unknown
`kind` with structural `ERR_WRONG_KIND`. An explicitly selected family uses that
same code when the document's kind differs from its bound constant. Dispatch
never precedes parser/profile checks.

**Shared grammar ownership.** Family sources identify core's label grammar with
`x-musher-grammar: label`. Bundles inline its constraints from §5.1; published
bundles are self-contained. Source copies do not independently author the pattern.

**Endpoint semantics.** Component defines self endpoint paths, as
`self.endpoints.<name>.<property>`. Blueprint consumes that definition. Core
defines syntax only.

**Reserved namespaces.** `parameters`, `deployment`, `environment`, `organization`
and `output` are reserved and unsupported in v1 reference strings.

## <a id="security"></a>11. Security considerations

This section is addressed to **implementations**: what a validator, a CLI, or a
control plane must do so that reading an untrusted Musher document is safe.
[SECURITY.md](../../../.github/SECURITY.md) is the separate question of what counts as a
vulnerability *in this repository* and how to report one.

A Musher document is untrusted input. It arrives from a pull request, a
catalog submission, or a `POST` body, and every consideration below assumes its
author is hostile. Each family specification adds what is specific to its own
documents.

**Parsing.** [§6.1](#yaml-profile) is a security boundary as much as an
interoperability one. Aliases are refused because expansion is where a small
document becomes a large one, and the size bound is measured before parsing
because a limit applied after the tree exists is not a limit on the work done to
build it. An implementation MUST enforce all three bounds, and MUST NOT raise
them to accommodate a document that exceeds them.

An implementation MUST NOT resolve YAML tags to host language types. The tag ban
makes this unreachable through a conforming parser, but a parser configured to
construct arbitrary objects from tags is the classic deserialisation
vulnerability, and the ban is not a substitute for choosing a safe loader.

**Regular expressions.** Every `pattern` a Musher schema publishes is free of
lookaround and backreferences, which is what lets it compile under RE2 as well as
under a backtracking engine. An implementation evaluating these patterns on a
backtracking engine SHOULD apply a match timeout regardless: the guarantee is
about the patterns published here, not about any the platform composes with them.

**Diagnostics.** An implementation MUST NOT include resolved configuration values
in a diagnostic message. Diagnostics are logged, attached to pull requests, and
printed in CI output, and a validator that echoes the value it rejected turns a
validation error into a disclosure.

**Paths inside an item.** A path a document names inside its item is a path an
implementation will open, chosen by the document's author. An implementation
MUST decide containment on the **resolved** location rather than on the string:
a path is an escape if what it resolves to lies outside the item root, whether it
got there by `../`, by an absolute path, or by a symbolic link inside the tree.

Symlinks are the case worth stating plainly. A link committed inside an item can
point anywhere the process can read, so an implementation MUST resolve links
before testing containment, and MUST treat a dangling link resolving outside the
root as an escape — containment is a property of the resolved location, not of
whether the target happens to exist. The conformance corpus fixtures this
directly; see [docs/conformance.md](../../../docs/conformance.md#case-trees).

An implementation MUST NOT follow a path outside the item root even when the
resulting file would be readable and would parse. The rule is about what a
reviewer of the item can see: a document that reaches outside the directory being
reviewed brings in something the review did not cover.

**Schema retrieval.** Every published bundle is self-contained: all `$ref`s
resolve inside `$defs`, and no validator needs a network request to evaluate a
document ([README](../../../README.md)). An implementation SHOULD vendor the
schema at an exact version rather than fetching it, and MUST verify what it
fetches if it does — the `.sha256` beside each pinned URL and `published.json`
are there for that. A validator that resolves schemas over the network at
validation time is an SSRF primitive and a runtime dependency on an origin it
does not control.
