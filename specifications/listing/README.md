# Listing specification

A listing document describes the catalog storefront entry for a blueprint or
component item: how it is presented, categorised, and discovered. It carries
presentation only, and is never an input to deployment.

A listing is an [item document](../core/v1/spec.md#item-directory),
`listing.yaml`, at the root of the catalog item it presents.

## Versions

| Major | Specification | Examples | Released? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v1` | [`v1/spec.md`](v1/spec.md) | [`v1/examples/`](v1/examples/) | Released from [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/musher-dev/specifications/releases/tag/listing%2Fv1.0.0). Every release is in [`published.json`](../../published.json) ([how to tell](../../docs/publication.md#draft-or-released)) |

## Start here

1. The [core specification](../core/README.md), which this one applies
2. [§2 Document envelope](v1/spec.md#envelope), for what this family binds
3. [§3 Identity](v1/spec.md#identity), and the item root
   [§3.1](v1/spec.md#item-directory) locates
4. [§4 Presentation](v1/spec.md#presentation), including
   [§4.1 The description Markdown profile](v1/spec.md#description-markdown)
5. [§5 Media](v1/spec.md#media), [§5.1 Resolution after
   ingest](v1/spec.md#media-resolution) and
   [§7 Diagnostics](v1/spec.md#diagnostics)

An implementation implements every section of this specification and of each
specification it builds on, together with the external specifications they cite.
This one cites [CommonMark 0.31.2](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/), for the
description profile in §4.1, [RFC
3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986), and the
[SPDX licence list](https://spdx.org/licenses/) for `license`. The list above is
where to begin, not what to implement.

## Builds on

Core v1. The authoritative list is the "Normative dependencies" table in
[§2](v1/spec.md#envelope).

## Requirement IDs

| Prefix | Covers | Section |
|---|---|---|
| `LIST-ITEM` | Agreement between the listing and the item holding it | [§3](v1/spec.md#identity) |
| `LIST-MD` | The description Markdown profile | [§4.1](v1/spec.md#description-markdown) |
| `LIST-MEDIA` | Media paths on disk | [§5](v1/spec.md#media) |

Every ID, the clause stating it, and the cases pinning it:
[listing/v1 in docs/traceability.md](../../docs/traceability.md#listingv1).
